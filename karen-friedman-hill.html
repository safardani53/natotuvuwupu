Karen was born into a Jewish family, but we had no idea who her parents were.</p><p>She has two siblings, Sandy and Adrienne. These two sisters had helped Karen lead her life.</p><p>Being a gangster’s wife, Karen led a nomadic life; she had to run to different areas, and her sisters helped to move to the new place, sometimes even taking care of the children.</p><p>There is no educational information about Karen available on the internet. We will update this section shortly.</p><p>But Karen was a dental hygienist before getting married to Henry.

And their grandparents and aunts took care of them.</p><p>Then, in 1973, something unfortunate happened, and Henry was sentenced to 10 years in jail for some extortion case. During that period, Karen lived a hellish life.</p><p>The gangster associates targeted Karen and her child because the gangsters fear that Henry will tell the truth about the gangster world to save himself.</p><p>As a result, Karen took the runway to various locations. To save everyone’s lives, Henry told the truth to the court.</p><p>Henry promised the judiciary officials that he would lead a new and good life; thus, the court released him, and the whole Henry family was sent to the Witness Protection Program in Omaha.</p><p>Under the witness programme, everyone’s identities were changed in Omaha. But even there, the gangster associates didn’t leave Henry alone and forced him to do drug trafficking.</p><p>Then again, Henry was sentenced to jail, and all of them were expelled from the witness program.</p><p>Meanwhile, Karen had an affair with Paul de Vario and</p><p>decided to divorce Henry.</p><p>In 2012, Henry Hill, the mafia gangster, died of heart disease.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Friedman_Hill_Ex-Husband></span>Karen Friedman Hill Ex-Husband<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karen Friedman Hill’s ex-husband’s name was Henry Hill. Karen and Henry met on a blind date, fell in love, and decided to get married, but Karen’s parents didn’t approve because Henry was not Jewish.</p><p>Thus, the couple eloped to North Carolina and dated for many months. In the meantime, they convinced their parents, and the marriage was held as per Jewish culture.</p><p>The Couple then had two children, Gregg and Gina. But the relationship became strained, and Karen had an affair with the gangster boss’s son, Paul de Vario Jr.</p><p>Thus, the couple filed for divorce in 1989, but their divorce was finalized in 2002.</p><p>But after that, Herny married Kelly Alor. Then he divorced her again, and Henry dated Lisa Caserta before dying of heart disease in 2002.</p><p>But there needs to be current information about Karen dating life.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Albin Kurti Biography</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Karen_Friedman_Hill_Net_Worth></span>Karen Friedman Hill Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Karen Friedman Hill estimated net worth is $1 million as of 2023.
