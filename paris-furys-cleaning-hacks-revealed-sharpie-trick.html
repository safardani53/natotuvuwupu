her spare time you won't see her kicking back with the telly on, but instead CLEANING.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/paris-fury-makes-epic-barbie-833411855-1.jpg><p>In her new book ‘How Does She Do It?’, boxing sensation Tyson Fury's wife has laid out some of her top tips for keeping her busy home in Morecombe, Lancs., looking spick and span.&nbsp;</p><p>From Zoflora disinfectant to dousing stains with Fairy Liquid, Fabulous has broken down Paris’s top cleaning hacks and tips to get your place looking spotless.&nbsp;</p><p>The best thing is they're cheap and easy to do... thanks Paris!</p><h2><strong>ACT QUICKLY&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bd363891-fbac-49c5-bc85-58f85c295760-1.jpg><p>With seven little ones running around, Paris has unsurprisingly had to deal with her fair share of stubborn stains.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more celebrity stories">Read more celebrity stories</h2><p>She writes that when it comes to tarnished clothing, her mantra is to “Act quickly!”&nbsp;</p><p>“The faster you act the better,” she said. “Because the offending substance will have less time to sink in and become permanent.</p><p>“For liquid spillages, I always try to blot rather than scrub.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve had all sorts of stuff on my carpets over the years – Ribena, red wine, tomato sauce – and whenever this happens, I’ll immediately make a dash for some kitchen roll or an old tea towel.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>She said trying to soak up as much of the stain as she can without scrubbing, “even if that means applying countless sheets of paper until everything’s absorbed."</p><h2>FAIRY LIQUID</h2><p>But if that doesn’t work, the savvy mum has a nifty “Plan B”, which she calls the “Fairy Liquid option”.&nbsp;</p><p>Dilute it with some water, she suggests, before “giving the carpet a good dab”.&nbsp;</p><p>“And failing that,” she said.</p><p>"Well, I just have to live with an annoying pink stain or hide it beneath an item of furniture!”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>STICK TO THE PRODUCTS&nbsp;</strong>YOU LOVE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pictures-instagram-boosted-tyson-fury-779171251.jpg><p>We’ve all seen the endless TikTok hacks that tout bizarre cupboard staples as ideal cleaning products.&nbsp;</p><p>“From removing stains to reducing waste, social media is full of household hacks,” Paris said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some friends of mine swear by vinegar or lemon juice to polish windows or bicarbonate of soda to keep things fresh and odour-free.&nbsp;</p><p>But according to the savvy mum, she tends to “stick to conventional cleaning fluids."</p><p>Having a large property means she gets through “dozens of bottles” a month, but she says the expense is worth the result.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m a big fan of good old-fashioned bleach,” she said</p><p>!II also use lots of Zoflora disinfectant for floors and surfaces.”&nbsp;</p><p>She’s also a fan of Mr Muscle Window Cleaner, which she describes as “one of the few sprays that don’t streak my windows”.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;<strong>SPLASH OUT ON THE SPONGES</strong></h2><p>With a house of nine, it’s inevitable that Paris is going to have to tackle more grime than the average mum.&nbsp;</p><p>And she swears by microfibre cloths – the thick, blue, old-school ones – to get the place sparkling.&nbsp;</p><p>“I couldn’t do without my microfibre cloths,” she said.</p><p>“I can use [them] wet or dry (and with or without cleaning fluids).”&nbsp;</p><p>A plain, dry microcloth is perfect for buffing the smudges from mirrors or from varnished cabinets and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re also fab for collecting “dust and dirt," she said because they have better absorbency than cotton cloths.&nbsp;</p><p>“I always pay money for good-quality cloths,” the cleaning whizz said “because they tend to be more absorbent and long-lasting”.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>HAIRSPRAY FOR SHARPIES</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-781722413.jpg><p>Paris does admit to having one unusual hack that she discovered completely “by accident”.&nbsp;</p><p>“Tyson always has a pile of memorabilia to sign at home – his books, his photographs, his boxing gloves,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>So her husband is often walking around with a Sharpie pen – and, naturally, the black ink can get everywhere, “especially on the kitchen table and on the worktops”.&nbsp;</p><p>“For a long while, I couldn’t find any detergents that would remove it,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>"[But one day] there happened to be a hairspray can in the kitchen (don’t ask me why!)."</p><p>Fed-up with the seemingly irremovable spot, the cleaning whizz decided to give a stubborn Sharpie stain on the wall a quick squirt, followed by a wipe-down with a damp cloth.&nbsp;</p><p>“Miraculously, it worked a treat,” Paris said</p><p>"Only leaving a faint taste of ink.</p><p>“I supposed I should add a disclaimer here.... what works for me may not work for others.</p><p>“But that can of hairspray is now kept permanently in my utility room, to deal with future Sharpie marks.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>STICK TO A ROUTINE&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000747790493.jpg><p>Paris said that cleaning such a large house often feels like quite a daunting task, so she makes sure to split the days into segments and clean certain places at different times.&nbsp;</p><p>Each morning, “after a very big mug of coffee”, she has a quick look around the house to “work out which jobs are more pressing”.&nbsp;</p><p>Paris then always tackles the laundry bin first – “you can only imagine how much laundry a family of nine generates” – before loading the first batch into the machine.&nbsp;</p><p>While they wash, she’ll vacuum around upstairs and downstairs, meaning that when the kids are at school her house remains “clean and orderly”.&nbsp;</p><p>Between home time and bedtime, Paris admits that she “has to forget about being house-proud for a few hours”.&nbsp;</p><p>“As the children let off steam and drag out their toys, the place can look like a bombsight,” she confesses.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just have to shrug my shoulders and let them get on with it.”&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of chasing them around picking things up, she waits until the kids are tucked up in bed, at which point she’ll “tour the house, checking every room and peering into every nook and cranny”.&nbsp;</p><p>“Every game will be returned to the toy box, every book will be replaced on the shelf, and every crisp packet or drinks carton will be chucked in the bin.”&nbsp;</p><p>By the time the clock strikes eight, she says the home is a “clutter-free zone."&nbsp;</p><p>“‘Wow, you wouldn’t even know we had seven kids…’ I’ll say to Tyson as we relax on the couch.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DELEGATE THE BURDEN</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/inside-paris-furys-eldest-daughters-765665543-1.jpg> <img

when it comes to tidying.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old Venezuela, Paris and Tyson’s eldest daughter, is now home-schooled, and helps her mum with the chores before lunchtime, before lessons in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair clean the kitchen together, emptying the bins and loading the dishwasher, and Venezuela will polish the mirrors and mop the floor.&nbsp;</p><p>“Two or three times a week,” Paris writes, “we might jointly tackle a more time-intensive chore.”</p><p>“That might be cleaning the windows top to bottom, or clearing out the bedroom doors and wardrobes.</p><p>“Venezuela is such a great help, and never complains. We’re quite similar in that respect.”&nbsp;</p><p>Paris also says that 11-year-old Prince has his own special responsibilities, including keeping his parent’s cars clean inside and out.&nbsp;</p><p>“Since he’s a well-built lad,” Paris adds, he helps her “haul big bags of toys or laundry up and down the stairs, or assist with our weight suitcases if I need to load them into the van.”&nbsp;</p><p>Even youngsters Adonis and Valenica help pick up messy toys or lay the table before dinner.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“They might take 20 minutes to finish a job I’d usually whizz through in 10,” Paris says, “but that’s neither here nor there.”&nbsp;</p><p>“For me, it’s the principle of the matter. It’s about lending a hand and learning new skills.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FtampsY26CcLzAq6CsZZaqv7q%2FjJyjnpmenruoeceamqSrXaeyt7HApZydZaOdrrO8yJ5kraqZmLhw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html&text=Paris%20Fury%27s%207%20secret%20cleaning%20hacks%20-%20from%20a%201p%20trick%20to%20remove%20stains%20to%20what%20to%20do%20when%20a%20kid%20tip&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html&title=Paris%20Fury%27s%207%20secret%20cleaning%20hacks%20-%20from%20a%201p%20trick%20to%20remove%20stains%20to%20what%20to%20do%20when%20a%20kid%20tip" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html&title=Paris%20Fury%27s%207%20secret%20cleaning%20hacks%20-%20from%20a%201p%20trick%20to%20remove%20stains%20to%20what%20to%20do%20when%20a%20kid%20tip" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html&title=Paris%20Fury%27s%207%20secret%20cleaning%20hacks%20-%20from%20a%201p%20trick%20to%20remove%20stains%20to%20what%20to%20do%20when%20a%20kid%20tip" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fparis-furys-cleaning-hacks-revealed-sharpie-trick.html&description=Paris%20Fury%27s%207%20secret%20cleaning%20hacks%20-%20from%20a%201p%20trick%20to%20remove%20stains%20to%20what%20to%20do%20when%20a%20kid%20tip" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-lauren-conrad.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Lauren Conrad?
