Hence, conventionality was tossed out of the window during his wedding with&nbsp;girlfriend Claire&nbsp;Beck-Alper of&nbsp;over <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five years</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So what elements contributed to make Mr. Fruit's wedding an absolute delight? Here, we have all the insight!</p><h2>Mr. Fruit and Girlfriend Claire Got Married in August 2020</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode 50</a> of GG over EZ podcast, Mr. Fruit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that he got married back on&nbsp;August 8, 2020. He had actually hinted about his wedding on August 7, 2020, by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeting</a>, "Tomorrow Ms. Fruit becomes Mrs. Fruit."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With his regular podcast mates Rhabby and Blue in attendance, along with artist John Silva, Fruit shared that the wedding was low-key due to the pandemic, and this is where it gets interesting, as the newly married couple&nbsp;had&nbsp;their puppies posing as&nbsp;witnesses to their wedding vows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same podcast, the YouTuber also mentioned that although his real name isn't Fruit, his wife Claire was more than happy to&nbsp;take the name if he could legally change his last name to Fruit.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, he didn't do it as it wouldn't sit well with his parents. With a ride-or-die commitment like that, it makes sense he put a ring on it, even though it took him a few&nbsp;years.</p><h2>Mr. Fruit and Claire Have Been in a Relationship for over Five Years</h2><p>The proposal from Mr. Fruit came after dating Claire for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five years</a>.&nbsp;He proposed to Claire back in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 2018,&nbsp;</a>and they had made their engagement official through an announcement on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On December 11, 2019, Mr. Fruit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared </a>their engagement photos on Twitter along with their first-ever photo taken together.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Claire and I’s first photo together and our most recent (part of our engagement photos).

On August 15, 2015, Claire,&nbsp;who is good at making handmade posters, posted a photo of a gift sent by Mr. Fruit and referred to him as "bae," meaning they were already together for some time before that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They appeared in each other's social media timelines a few more times since then, remarkably in party photos and funny tweets. Their first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture </a>together on Instagram was from Claire's graduation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One could see their budding relationship and the strength and togetherness they built through these adorable posts.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My best friend.
