I’d got all these preconceived ideas.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="more on maudsley">more on maudsley</h2><p>"If you didn’t know him and what he’d done, and you saw him in the bar... he’s a really intelligent guy, who made you smile.</p><p>"He’d talk about everyday things. A lot of serial killers are intense and narcissistic and talk about themselves.</p><p>"I didn’t find him like that at all. I thought, ‘Wow, this is something different to any serial killer'."</p><p>In January 2023, Maudsley broke the world record for solitary confinement - in a perspex box thought to have inspired Hannibal Lecter’s glass case in Silence of the Lambs.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Maudsley, from Toxeth in <a href=#>Liverpool</a>, carried out his first murder in 1974 when a builder called John Farrell picked him up and took him back to his flat in North London for sex while the killer was working as a rent boy.</p><p>When Farrell showed him photos of a young girl he had abused, Maudsley, then 20, flew into a rage and slowly garrotted him, turning the builder’s face blue.</p><p>He handed himself into police and was sent to Broadmoor hospital — where he soon earned his first nickname, “Blue”, after the colour of his victim’s face.</p><p>But soon after in 1977, Maudsley was given the new moniker of "Spoons" after his first gruesome prison murder.</p><p>He and another psychopath took an inmate hostage in his cell and tortured him to death for nine hours.</p><p>The man was discovered with his head "cracked open like a boiled egg" with a spoon hanging out.</p><p>A guard then claimed Maudsley had eaten part of the victim's brain, which led to the monster being marked with a "cannibal" tag - despite the grim information being false.</p><p>Maudsley was convicted of manslaughter and sent to Wakefield prison - known as Monster Mansion because of the large number of notorious prisoners held there.</p><p>It was here that the fiend went on another bloody rampage - slaughtering two fellow lags in one day in 1978.</p><p>The first was Salney Darwood, 46, who he lured into his cell before strangling and stabbing him with a knife made from a soup spoon and hiding his body under a bunk.</p><p>He then crept into the cell of William Roberts, who was lying on his bed, and smashed his head against a wall before using the homemade weapon to prise open his skull.</p><p>The brute then calmly walked into the wing office and told guards: “There’ll be two short on the roll call.”</p><p>Maudsley now spends 23 hours a day in "the cage" - a bulletproof glass cell built specifically for him in 1983 after he was officially classed Britain's most dangerous prisoner.</p><p>While languishing alone in the cell, Maudsley writes letters and poems to his nephew Gavin, who regularly visits him in jail.</p><p>The psycho has a genius level IQ and enjoys fine art, poetry and classical music - as well as documentaries about animals.</p><p>In a documentary, The Killer In My Family, Gavin told the show: "He likes to write us letters and tell me what he's been watching on TV.</p><p>"He really loves the wildlife programmes as well, the Attenborough ones, things like that."</p><p>During his early days in solitary, Maudsley is said to have befriended cockroaches and went without a haircut for 12 years because no prison barber would touch him.</p><p>He still signs his handwritten letters "Wolfie" when his appearance led to another moniker - the Wolf Man of Wakefield.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Maudsley is serving four life sentences - spending every day in solitary confinement with just an hour's exercise a day while being flanked by six guards.</p><p>His record means he can't have contact with any other prisoners - although he is said to have had run-ins with infamous prisoner Charles Bronson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JyhZduaW5npaDAbrnOrKtmnJGjtKa%2Bzq6qZqOZobmmvoylppyjlZl6qrqMoKOaq6NisKKzxGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html&text=I%20interviewed%20UK%27s%20most%20dangerous%20killer%20locked%20in%20glass%20cage%20underground%20%26amp%3b%20he%20%27made%20me%20smile%27...%20it&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html&title=I%20interviewed%20UK%27s%20most%20dangerous%20killer%20locked%20in%20glass%20cage%20underground%20%26amp%3b%20he%20%27made%20me%20smile%27...%20it" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html&title=I%20interviewed%20UK%27s%20most%20dangerous%20killer%20locked%20in%20glass%20cage%20underground%20%26amp%3b%20he%20%27made%20me%20smile%27...%20it" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html&title=I%20interviewed%20UK%27s%20most%20dangerous%20killer%20locked%20in%20glass%20cage%20underground%20%26amp%3b%20he%20%27made%20me%20smile%27...%20it" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fuks-most-dangerous-killer-locked-in-glass-cage.html&description=I%20interviewed%20UK%27s%20most%20dangerous%20killer%20locked%20in%20glass%20cage%20underground%20%26amp%3b%20he%20%27made%20me%20smile%27...%20it" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-lumpy-jaw-unedited-pics-procedures.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian fans wince at her 'lumpy jaw' in unedited pics at Vegas casino party and beg her to '">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./two-friends-djs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Two Friends (DJs) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
