Passengers on board shared details and footage of the chaos and destruction caused by the storm on social media. Thankfully, Carnival told PEOPLE in a statement provided below that "no one was seriously injured."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crew Center, a cruise ship information site, posted a video on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a> showing a flooded hallway, torn-off doors and other debris and destruction on board.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The aftermath aboard Carnival Sunshine after a severe storm," the post read. "The crew from Deck 0-4 evacuated to the theater, and anywhere they could rest… the crew bar destroyed."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>brad morrell/storyful</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Passenger Daniel Taylor told Newsweek that the captain made an announcement around 4:45 p.m. saying that they would be experiencing a delay due to "adverse weather conditions," expressing that they "would do everything they could to minimize discomfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By dinner time, public decks had been closed off, and plates and cups were flying off the buffet areas, he recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the early hours of Saturday morning, he said, "We were no longer able to see where we were going, how fast we were going, what the wind speed was, or anything. We were blind to what was going on." Swells were hitting the ship "over and over," said Taylor, who also recalled seeing crew members wearing life vests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At that point, the internet was also out, so those on board couldn't get any additional information or reach loved ones.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Matthew Branham, who was also on board, told The Washington Post, that "waves were hitting the boat so hard that it was like an earthquake experience, jarring you like a really rough roller coaster — even in the middle floor."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">TVs were falling off walls and glasses shattering. “You could not stand up in your room,” he said. “You could be thrown from the bed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another passenger, RJ Whited, wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post cited by Newsweek, "Our cruise ship last night was literally sideways and slung everything in our room breaking, people in the hallways throwing up and sleeping on the stairs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Added Whited, "We also found out that they knew about the storm and instead of us staying back to ride it out a few hours they hit it head-on so we could make it back for the other cruise to be on time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, the ship made it back to Charleston around 7:30 a.m., though it couldn't immediately dock due to continuing rough weather.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, the ship was able to dock.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Summing up the "nightmare" experience, passenger Christa Seifert-Alicea told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NBC News 4</a>: "What we endured is indescribable, not only to feel it yourself but to hear and see it set in on every single person around you from adult, child and the elderly is something I will never forget."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement to PEOPLE on Wednesday, Carnival said: "Carnival Sunshine's return to Charleston was impacted by the weather and rough seas on Saturday. The weather's prolonged impact on the Charleston area delayed the ship's arrival and as a result, the next voyage's embarkation was also delayed. We appreciate the patience and understanding of all our guests."</p><p>The statement claims that "the ship's crew followed our protocols for rough weather" noting, "thankfully, no one was seriously injured."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The weather was unexpectedly strong, causing conditions that were rougher than forecasted," the statement continues. "Given the circumstances as they were, the ship's officers and our Fleet Operations Center team using real time meteorology data coordinated to keep the ship in its safest location. Attempting to sail out of the large front could have been dangerous. The ship proceeded to the port as soon as the weather began to clear."</p><p>The cruise line's statement also said that the captain "made several announcements about the weather and the delay" but noted "some of the worst weather occurred in the overnight hours when announcements are not typically made."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Carnival Sunshine is already on its next voyage, the cruise line confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Onwqq%2FxGaqoaGgYrumrdGlsGaclajBs7vYnptmq5Geuaq6xmaroaqfqrSpecSaqq1lk6SutMCMrKuoqp1itq95l2lkpqiYYsSqusOsZHBtYGt9eoI%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html&text=Cruise%20Passengers%20Share%20Scary%20Videos%20from%20Storm%20at%20Sea&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html&title=Cruise%20Passengers%20Share%20Scary%20Videos%20from%20Storm%20at%20Sea" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html&title=Cruise%20Passengers%20Share%20Scary%20Videos%20from%20Storm%20at%20Sea" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html&title=Cruise%20Passengers%20Share%20Scary%20Videos%20from%20Storm%20at%20Sea" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcruise-ship-nearly-destroyed-sailing-through-east-coast-storm-in-80-mph-winds-7506096.html&description=Cruise%20Passengers%20Share%20Scary%20Videos%20from%20Storm%20at%20Sea" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./director-james-haggar-and-her-wife-naga-munchetty-married-divorce-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Director James Hagger And His Wife Naga Munchetty's Marriage, Divorce And Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-the-last-ronin-tmnt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is the Last Ronin in 'TMNT'?
