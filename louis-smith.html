Born as Louis Antoine Smith, he was brought up in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, England, where he was born.</p><p>Likewise, about his parents, Louis’ mother is English, whereas his father is Jamaican-born. However, his parents separated when he was three.&nbsp;</p><p>At a young age, the champion athlete was diagnosed with&nbsp;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 1995. So, due to this, he had to take medication and was on Ritalin for a year. He was six at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At seven, Louis got offered a choral scholarship. Still, since his primary focus was developing a career in the field of gymnastics, he chose not to accept it and focus on gymnastics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pppppp.jpg><p>The star pommel horse champion learned to use the pommel with the help of a bucket tied and hung from the ceiling where he put his feet. And, that was a beginning of a tremendous, respectful journey that has now reached great heights.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about education, Louis attended&nbsp;<a title="Arthur Mellows Village College" href=#>Arthur Mellows Village College</a> in Glinton, Cambridgeshire.
