"It's an opportunity to not only pay tribute to a true icon in the daytime television world, but it's also a chance to recognize the lifelong achievements of a great and well-respected actor, who also happens to be my dad."</p><p>"For over 30 years, his dedication to that show has gained him respect and admiration of his fellow actors, deep friendships and thrilled millions of fans around the world," she added. "His career is literally the definition of lifetime achievement," the 53-year-old added.</p><p>John shared Jennifer with his ex-wife Nancy Dow who died in May 2016.</p><p>He left Nancy, a model, in November 1979 after 11 years of marriage when Jennifer was 10-years-old.</p><p>John also had a son, Alexander, with his second wife, Sherry Rooney whom he met while co-starring on Love of Life.</p><p><a href=#>John and Sherry were pictured out and about</a> together in March 2020 as he made a rare public appearance in Ventura County - just north of Los Angeles.</p><p>John, who reportedly recovered from a heart attack in 2006, appeared jovial as he browsed cut-priced items during a 40-minute shop.</p><p>“He looked like any other elderly man enjoying cheap fast food with locals and riding around Costco on his mobility scooter,” an eyewitness told The U.S. Sun.</p><p>“He doesn’t seem to be able to get around like he used to and was unsteady on his feet before getting into the scooter, but Sherry was taking good care of him."</p><h2>JEN'S RECONCILIATION</h2><p>That same year, it was reported that <a href=#>Jennifer had forgiven her father</a> for walking out on her as a child and rang him every day amid the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>A source close to John told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Mail On Sunday</a> at the time: "Jen forgave her father for walking out a long time ago. But their relationship has had its ups and downs.</p><p>"Jennifer didn't speak to him for ages. But since the coronavirus crisis, she has been on the phone almost every day. And not just brief conversations."</p><p>The insider added: "It's like she has realized life is very short and she wants her relationship with John to be the best it can be. He's thrilled that they have reconciled."</p><p>The We're The Millers actress previously recalled the incident in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>The Rolling Stones</a>, explaining that John left her mother for another woman.</p><p>She said at the time: "I went to a birthday party, and when I came back, my mother said, 'Your father's not going to be around here for a little while'.</p><p>"She didn't say he was gone for ever. I don't know if I blocked it, but I just remember sitting there, crying, not understanding that he was gone. I don't know what I did later that night or the next day.</p><p>"I don't remember anything other than it being odd that all of a sudden my father wasn't there. And he was gone for a while, about a year," Jennifer added.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In a gushing interview with E! News back in 1990, John said of his daughter: "Jennifer is a natural talent.</p><p>"There are certain things you can learn in this business, and there are certain things you can't learn. The comic instinct that she has in unerring.
