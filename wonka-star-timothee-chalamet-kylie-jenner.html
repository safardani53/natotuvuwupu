To everyone he was a celebrity before he got famous and girls were infatuated by him, not just his talents or that he was cute.”</p><p>Timothee might want to forget some of those early performances, though.</p><p>There are videos of him rapping on stage at LaGuardia in a way that could damage his street cred.</p><p>Every year he would do a bit on stage at the school as his hip-hop persona Little Timmy.</p><p>Former drama teacher Harry Shifman says: “Little Timmy was maybe his secret passion, he could make it as a rap star.”</p><p>But the students enjoyed it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/lmk106-j10336-011223-supplied-lmkmedia-864011451-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kylie-jenner-actor-timoth-e-850559311.jpg><p>Lindsey comments: “We had this talent show every year called Rising Stars and he became a staple.</p><p>“He did this rap and he had people dance behind him and everyone was always excited for Timmy Tim.</p><p>“He would have all these girls and guys doing hip-hop dancing behind him.”</p><p>Lindsey remembers Timothee dating Lourdes, who was a year below him.</p><p>She says: “We all did Sweet Charity.</p><p>“They both spoke French fluently and would always speak in French and it was almost like a secret language.</p><p>“They had a great young love and I enjoyed being friends with them as a couple.</p><p>“The relationship ran its course, I don’t think it turned sour.”</p><p>Timmy and Lourdes would always speak in French and it was almost like a secret language. They had a great young love.</p><span class=quote-credit>Lindsey Spohler</span><p>According to Lourdes, Timothee was her first relationship.</p><p>She said: “We were a little item. My first boyfriend.”</p><p>By the age of 15, Timothee had an agent and at 17 he went to Columbia University in New York before ‘dropping out’.</p><p>In 2012 he secured a regular part as the son of the vice president in the hit CIA drama series <a href=#>Homeland</a> and two years later was cast in director Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi movie Interstellar.</p><p>His major breakthrough arrived playing the young summer love of Armie Hammer’s character in the Oscar-nominated Call Me By Your Name.</p><p>Timothee was nominated for best actor at the 2018 Academy awards, losing out to <a href=#>Gary Oldman</a> for his role as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.</p><p>Not long afterwards, Lily-Rose Depp appeared to fall for him while they were making the Netflix movie The King, based on William Shakespeare’s plays Henry IV and Henry V.</p><p>They were spotted kissing in the rain in <a href=#>New York</a> in October 2018, shortly after the shoot finished.</p><p>But the romance only lasted for 18 months, with them both having intense work schedules.</p><p>The actor demonstrated his dedication to the job by losing 18lb for the role of a young drug addict in Beautiful Boy in 2018.</p><p>And he is used to making eye-catching style statements.</p><p>For red carpet events he has turned up in a rose print suit and worn a sequin hoodie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/united-states-united-kingdom-australia-864018976.jpg><p>That is another trait that has attracted female suitors.</p><p>In the summer of 2020 he started dating <a href=#>Eiza Gonzalez</a>, best known for her starring role in TV series From Dusk Till Dawn.</p><p>But it was short-lived and his next major romance seems to be with Kylie, which began in April this year.</p><p>The reality-TV star had only broken up with long-term partner <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> a few months earlier.</p><p>She has two children with the 32-year-old rapper who she had been seeing on and off for six years.</p><p>There was a lot of scepticism about the rumours that Timothee and Kylie were an item until the clip of them kissing provided proof.</p><p>Some of his obsessed fans did not take well to the evidence.</p><p>One site, Club Chalamet, posted a message on X/Twitter saying, “If you’re feeling distressed by the video, it’s OK.”</p><p>Fans fear that Timothee will suddenly start appearing in the Kardashians reality show.</p><p>But that seems unlikely, given the demand for his services in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>.</p><p>In 2021 he appeared in three movies, the Netflix hit Don’t Look Up in which he snogged <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence’s</a> character, director Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch, as well as Dune.</p><p>He is the lead hero in sci-fi epic <a href=#>Dune</a>, the sequel of which will be out next year, starring Florence Pugh and Zendaya.</p><p>He was like a little Justin Bieber. The girls always loved Timmy and they were jealous of anyone getting to work with him.</p><span class=quote-credit>Lindsey Spohler</span><p>Undoubtedly, though, it is taking over from Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder as the eccentric chocolate obsessed Willy Wonka that is his biggest moment yet.</p><p>The musical Wonka is a prequel to the previous films and explores how Willy went from selling sweets in a candy store to owning his own factory.</p><p>There were high hopes for the new movie because it is directed by Paul King who made the critically-acclaimed Paddington movies, and it is receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews.</p><p>Paul said he cast Timothee as <a href=#>Roald Dahl’s</a> most famous creation because he is “the most incredible actor of his generation”.</p><p>If he lives up to that praise, there will be no stopping the young actor.</p><p>And it will come as little surprise to those people who knew him before he was famous.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>LaGuardia’s drama teacher Shifman concludes: “I believe he was always ambitious in terms of knowing that he wanted to be successful as an actor.</p><p>"He was determined to do so. I know that he set a goal for himself and he was determined to achieve it.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Baby-faced heart-throb</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/lmk110-j5374-300819-supplied-lmkmedia-526876091.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>By Sinead McIntyre, Fabulous Magazine Editor</p><p>MAYBE it’s because the first time I saw him he was playing Laurie in Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, one of my favourite characters in one of my all-time favourite childhood books.</p><p>I wept as Saoirse Ronan’s Jo told him she didn’t love him and rejoiced as he got together with Florence Pugh’s Amy despite having read the book about a dozen times.</p><p>And at that moment I fell hook, line and sinker for Timothee Chalamet.</p><p>And I’m not the only one.</p><p>Women around the world are obsessed with the floppy-haired, baby-faced heart-throb.</p><p>Perhaps we all just want to mother him, at 27 he is almost half my age.</p><p>One look from those gorgeous green eyes sets my heart aflutter.</p><p>Which is funny, considering I am married to a shaven-headed Scotsman.</p><p>But I defy any female who has seen Timothee in the Bleu de Chanel ads not to be gripped by Chalamania.</p><p>For starters, those cheekbones could cut glass.</p><p>He reminds me of a young Johnny Depp – minus the drinking, drugs and chaotic personal life.</p><p>And maybe that is the attraction. In a time of global upheaval, Timothee seems to represent innocence and has an air of old-fashioned charm and kindness.</p><p>And maybe that is exactly what we all need right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGiFd4WQaK6oppuWerTAwKtkraGdpMGpscRmmqGZnJa6psCMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6paA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html&text=How%20world%20has%20fallen%20in%20love%20with%20new%20Wonka%20Timothee%20Chalamet%2c%20the%20heartthrob%20who%20was%20dating%20celebs%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html&title=How%20world%20has%20fallen%20in%20love%20with%20new%20Wonka%20Timothee%20Chalamet%2c%20the%20heartthrob%20who%20was%20dating%20celebs%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html&title=How%20world%20has%20fallen%20in%20love%20with%20new%20Wonka%20Timothee%20Chalamet%2c%20the%20heartthrob%20who%20was%20dating%20celebs%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html&title=How%20world%20has%20fallen%20in%20love%20with%20new%20Wonka%20Timothee%20Chalamet%2c%20the%20heartthrob%20who%20was%20dating%20celebs%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwonka-star-timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner.html&description=How%20world%20has%20fallen%20in%20love%20with%20new%20Wonka%20Timothee%20Chalamet%2c%20the%20heartthrob%20who%20was%20dating%20celebs%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./xernona-clayton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Xernona Clayton">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chevy-chase-falls-off-stage-before-christmas-vacation-panel-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chevy Chase Falls Off-Stage Before Christmas Vacation Panel: Video  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
