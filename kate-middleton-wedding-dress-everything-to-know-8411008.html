The wedding dress was designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen and paid tribute to the United Kingdom through its lace embroidery. It later broke royal records when it was displayed at Buckingham Palace.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It has been the experience of a lifetime to work with Catherine Middleton to create her wedding dress, and I have enjoyed every moment of it," Burton said in a statement on the royal wedding day.

I am delighted that the dress represents the best of British craftsmanship.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over a decade since Kate wore it down the aisle, the timeless gown is still an inspiration to brides everywhere.

"Because my core team knew, it was okay for me to disappear and then come back, and then disappear again. But I remember other people asking me, 'Are you coming in on Friday?' And I'd say, 'Oh, yeah, see you in the morning'. I'd be scheduling meetings knowing full well I wasn't going to be there for them," she recalled to the publication.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kate-chose-alexander-mcqueen-for-the-fashion-houses-workmanship-and-artistic-vision></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kate chose Alexander McQueen for the fashion house’s “workmanship” and “artistic vision”</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Catherine Middleton has her dress adjusted by her sister and Maid of Honor Pippa Middleton as she arrives with her father Michael Middleton before her wedding at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Suzanne Plunkett - WPA Pool/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Burton’s name was officially revealed as the designer of the princess's wedding gown on the morning of April 29,<strong> </strong>Buckingham Palace explained Kate’s choice of the British designer in detail with a statement on the royal family website.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“​​Miss Catherine Middleton's wedding dress has been designed by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen,” the statement read. “Miss Middleton chose British brand Alexander McQueen for the beauty of its craftsmanship and its respect for traditional workmanship and the technical construction of clothing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement also said that Kate aimed to “combine tradition and modernity with the artistic vision that characterizes Alexander McQueen's work.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-embroiders-had-to-wash-their-hands-every-30-minutes-while-working-on-the-dress></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Embroiders had to wash their hands every 30 minutes while working on the dress</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Prince William exchanges rings with his bride Catherine Middleton in front of the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams inside Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Dominic Lipinski - WPA Pool/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>BBC</a>, extreme measures were taken to ensure that nothing would happen to the dress’s lace as a team of embroiderers aged 19 to 70 at the London Royal School of Needlework created it.

According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>royal family's website</a>, the lace was appliquéd using the Carrickmacross lace-making technique, which originated in Ireland in the 1820s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There was also more to the embroidery than met the eye. Four plant motifs, including a rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock, were hand-cut from lace and hand-appliquéd onto ivory silk tulle to represent England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — the four countries that comprise the United Kingdom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fifty-eight gazar- and organza-covered buttons lined the back of the bodice, all fastened by Rouleau loops.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-train-was-nearly-9-feet-long></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The train was nearly 9 feet long</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Catherine Middleton waves to the crowds as her sister and Maid of Honour Pippa Middleton holds her dress before walking in to the Abbey to attend the Royal Wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate's impressive train was quite lengthy, spanning nearly 9 feet.

The Cartier Halo tiara she wore, which held her ivory silk tulle veil in place, was her “something borrowed,” and was lent to her by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Elizabeth</a>. The tiara featured 739 brilliant-cut diamonds and 139 baguettes and was commissioned by King George VI for his wife, the Queen Mother, in 1936. It was presented to Queen Elizabeth on her 18th birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Its scroll motif was a great match for the Robinson Pelham earrings <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton</a>, had commissioned for her big day (her “something new”), the design of which — oak leaves with a pear-shaped diamond — was inspired by family's new coat of arms.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for her bouquet, it was shaped like a shield and included lily of the valley for happiness, sweet William for gallantry, hyacinth for consistency of love, ivy for fidelity and myrtle for love and marriage.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kate-had-a-final-fitting-the-day-before-the-wedding></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kate had a final fitting the day before the wedding</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Kate Middleton and Prince William on the balcony at Buckingham Palace after their wedding in 2011.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Stephane Cardinale/Corbis via Gett</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Embroider Chloe Savage told PEOPLE in 2011 that the Princess of Wales had a fitting just <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>one day before her nuptials</a> to ensure her measurements hadn’t changed. "Brides have a tendency to do things like drop [7 pounds] before a wedding and as her dress was going to be seen from every conceivable angle by a billion people, you couldn't have it being a bit saggy because she'd lost weight or gained a couple of ounces due to stress,” Savage said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the dress needed few alterations, according to Savage, the designers worked on the gown until 9 p.m. the night before the big day.
