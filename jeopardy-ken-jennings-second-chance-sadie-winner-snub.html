I understand why the judges did what they did, but you know that had to hurt," one fan wrote to Reddit.</p><p>"Sadie is 100% my pick for the whole Tournament Of Champions. Cinderella story, here we come" wrote a second.</p><p>"Vindication, hell yeah" wrote a third.</p><p>"I don’t think I’ve ever heard an applause like that! Everyone was rooting for Sadie," tweeted a fourth.</p><p>Sadie now goes to the finals of this week's comeback competition - her earnings tonight don't count.</p><p>But her win does - if she wins the two-part match on Thursday and Friday, she'll join last week's winner <a href=#>Jessica Stephens</a> and 19 others in the $250K <a href=#>Tournament of Champions.</a></p><h2>POETIC JUSTICE</h2><p>Sadie's prior loss in regularly airing <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;came down to one thing - the judge's ruling that her otherwise correct Final Jeopardy! response of "Harriet Tubman" was "incomplete."</p><p>Many felt Sadie was misjudged as she would have won if the show ruled in her favor -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">calling it the season's "most painful loss."</a></p><p>It all kicked off with the Final&nbsp;Jeopardy!&nbsp;clue: "Congratulating her on the 1869 release of her biography, Frederick Douglass wrote, 'I have wrought in the day- you in the night."</p><p>After a short time, contestant Molly Fleming correctly answered, "Who is Harriet Tubman," adding $3,200 to her winnings for a total of $6,500.</p><p>Then-champ Megan answered correctly to increase her final game total to $17,199.</p><p>Sadie also appeared to have the same answer in mind; however, judges off-camera decided she didn't write it out in full.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>- who is permanently&nbsp;<a href=#>sharing hosting duties</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken</a>&nbsp;- said: "It looks like you were going for 'Harriet Tubman,' but you did not finish, so, unfortunately, that is not going to be acceptable."</p><p>Sadie nodded in agreement but seemed to look disappointed in the results - as were fans to this day.</p><p>She ended up wagering $7,500, which would have given her a total of 17,300 if her answer was accepted and would have made her the new champ over Megan.</p><p>If Sadie wins this week's bracket in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Second Chance Tournament</a>, she could even theoretically face off against Megan again.</p><h2>'IT WAS A TOUGH RULING'</h2><p>In August, Jeopardy! producers broke their silence on the jaw-dropping defeat, claiming that they've "cleaned up some rules" going forward.</p><p>In an episode of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Hall of Fame</a>&nbsp;podcast hosted by&nbsp;<a href=#>Executive producer Mike Davies</a>&nbsp;and his&nbsp;co-host,&nbsp;<a href=#>"Clue Crew" member Sarah Foss,</a>&nbsp;Sadie's return was a big topic of discussion.</p><p>"Many will remember Sadie. She competed against Megan Wachpress, who you'll see in the Tournament of Champions," Sarah said.</p><p>A podcast guest and judge added: "Sadie had a strong game with 32 buzzer attempts. She led Megan going into Final Jeopardy.</p><p>"And she had an incomplete written response, and the game went to Megan instead."</p><p>Sarah sighed, "This is one of those things we wanted to bring up because it talks about what happens for us as judges in the game.</p><p>"When it comes to Final Jeopardy, you have to finish your response."</p><p>"We could actually go back and watch the tape, the style pens are timed out to 30 seconds with the music, and they stop working as soon as the time is up.</p><p>"In Sadie's case, we did go back.</p><p>"We stopped the show, we went back and watched it repeatedly - we can see she went through each of the letters.</p><p>"She wrote a 'T-U-B-M-A' and we knew she had not begun to write an N.'"</p><p>"I think in hindsight she wished she’d written 'Tubman' and not Harriet Tubman.'</p><p>EP Mike then spoke out: "We talked to Sadie. It was a tough ruling, it was a great game, and we're so happy we can invite her back."</p><p>"I'm trying to find some way we can find consistency. People cite things from seasons of yore - it's tough for me to deal with that."</p><p>Many fans were even happy the new tournament was created just so she could come back.</p><h2>TOURNAMENT TIME</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s&nbsp;brand new season&nbsp;premiered on&nbsp;<a href=#>September 12th</a>.</p><p>Regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return in a month.</p><p>Right now, airing instead is the never-before-done&nbsp;<a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a>&nbsp;which started last Monday.</p><p>Over this and last week, 18 snubbed players that nearly - but didn’t - win during their original&nbsp;games last year are duking it out in a redemption competition.</p><p>The players were all picked by the show specifically as those they felt deserved a second chance.</p><p>Each week has three semi-final games and a two-night finals with the same three finalists.</p><p>Then, the victor of each week will score the two remaining slots in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;which airs directly afterward - Stephens won the first bracket.</p><p>There, they can beat super-champs like&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schenider</a>, Matt Amodio,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Ryan Long</a>&nbsp;- or the legends they lost to - in the following two-week prestigious playoffs, starting Oct. 31st.</p><p>Both two-week-long tournaments will be hosted by Ken and will air at the usual time of 7 p.m. on ABC.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken will step aside from the iconic game show in January so that co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- can take the reins.</p><p>Over the summer, he and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/s-second-chance-tournament-return-767568822-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-6.51.05-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/fans-go-wild-contestant-scores-770462755.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWaEeoSWaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmarlZi8r7CMnJ%2BappOaerStw6KcZq%2BZo7umvoyspa6aXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html&text=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20go%20wild%20as%20contestant%20Sadie%20Goldberger%20wins%20Second%20Chance%20game%20after%20fury%20over%20her%20co&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20go%20wild%20as%20contestant%20Sadie%20Goldberger%20wins%20Second%20Chance%20game%20after%20fury%20over%20her%20co" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20go%20wild%20as%20contestant%20Sadie%20Goldberger%20wins%20Second%20Chance%20game%20after%20fury%20over%20her%20co" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20go%20wild%20as%20contestant%20Sadie%20Goldberger%20wins%20Second%20Chance%20game%20after%20fury%20over%20her%20co" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-second-chance-sadie-winner-snub.html&description=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20go%20wild%20as%20contestant%20Sadie%20Goldberger%20wins%20Second%20Chance%20game%20after%20fury%20over%20her%20co" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rayleen-vega-19990221-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rayleen Vega (YouTube Star) -
