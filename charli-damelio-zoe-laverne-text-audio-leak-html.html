However, with the advent of motherhood, the latter claimed to have grown a bit and changed her outlook on things between them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This led to her declaring that the beef between them was over in October 2021. However, nobody knew the inside details about their exchange in private until now. With text messages between the two&nbsp;and an audio clip being leaked online, it has shone a new light on the whole ordeal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Charli D’Amelio Apparently Made Zoe LaVerne Cry</h2><p>On April 23, 2022, TikTok Insiders, a TikTok gossip account on Instagram, posted an audio clip and screenshots of the texts exchanged between D'Amelio and LaVerne at what looked to be the end of their feud. The audio clip was of LaVerne talking about her experience with D'Amelio.</p><p>In the soundbite, someone who sounded like LaVerne claimed she apologized to D'Amelio "multiple times," but the latter always left her on read all the time, except one. And in the time she responded, she was, according to the voice, "wasn't very nice to [her]."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"She made me cry," LaVerne confessed during the clip. It's not clear where or when the clip is from yet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the following screenshots, D'Amelio wrote two long messages to LaVerne, making it clear that she was upset and that she did not care for her apologies.</p><p>D'Amelio was of the view that LaVerne had been against her from the beginning of her social media career. "you have been consistently trying to tear me down and degrade me," D'Amelio wrote.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>Charli D'Amelio and Zoe LaVerne's leaked texts where D'Amelio told LaVerne off.</strong> (Photo: TikTok Insiders/Instagram)</p><p>LaVerne also brought D'Amelio up when she was not a part of the subject, like Laverne's break up.</p><p>"I have never once done anything rude to you in the slightest yet you act incredibly immature towards me," D'Amelio wrote. "but maybe that is just who you are." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>D'Amelio continued, saying that LaVerne did not care about changing after&nbsp;so many video and photo leaks of her saying horrible things about her. She stated she was thriving on her own and did not need someone like LaVerne to bring her down.</p><p>In the next text, D'Amelio accused LaVerne of being insecure and taking the frustrations of her problems out on her. The former also criticized the latter's degrading remarks.</p><p>"I would watch what you say because people are definitely realizing that you are a genuinely just not a good person," D'Amelio remarked. "I do not want to be your friend nor do I think we will ever be."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The TikTok star ended her text by saying she did not want to surround herself with someone like LaVerne and requested her not to contact her again.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Right after this text, LaVerne sent her clarification on the matter. She said she just wanted to "get [her] feelings across as well."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Zoe LaVerne apologized to Charli D'Amelio for their beef.</strong> (Photo: TikTok Insiders/Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"i want you to listen to what I have to say," she wrote, explaining her tendencies to overthink and make things seem bigger than they actually are.</p><p>"i say a lot of things without processing or thinking of how it would effect [sic] others," she admitted, but also confessed she was working on herself, at which point, the screenshot cuts her message.</p><h2>History of Charli D’Amelio and Zoe LaVerne’s Drama</h2><p>The feud between the two TikTok stars began in July 2020, when a video leak of LaVerne crying about D'Amelio's more TikTok followers surfaced. The D'Amelio sister, who is the most followed person on the platform, did not respond to the video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, in November 2020, another clip of LaVerne talking down on D'Amelio got leaked. In this one, she was saying she did not like D'Amelio. She also used profanity during her rant.</p><p>D'Amelio responded to this one, posting the clip on her TikTok and resulting in an apology from LaVerne. LaVerne indirectly apologized, and according to her, D'Amelio ignored her private apologies.</p><p>Between this and October 2021, things remained relatively quiet between the two. LaVerne, however, found herself in other <a href=# rel="follow noopener">controversies surrounding</a> her personal life, like <a href=# rel=follow>selling her newborn's pictures</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>husband Dawson Day</a>'s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>TikTok ban</a>, and <a href=# rel=follow>death rumors</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During an interview with Insider in October 2021, she confessed she did not hate D'Amelio, despite what everyone believed. Having her&nbsp;baby, Emersyn, changed her perspective on things, and she <a href=# rel=follow>declared the beef had ended</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYlr%2BttYydmKadnJ68bsbOnmSlmaaav6%2BxjK2csaxdlsKltc5mo56Zm2O1tbnL</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html&text=Charli%20DAmelio%20and%20Zoe%20LaVernes%20Text%20Exchange%20and%20Audio%20Leak%20Online&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html&title=Charli%20DAmelio%20and%20Zoe%20LaVernes%20Text%20Exchange%20and%20Audio%20Leak%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html&title=Charli%20DAmelio%20and%20Zoe%20LaVernes%20Text%20Exchange%20and%20Audio%20Leak%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html&title=Charli%20DAmelio%20and%20Zoe%20LaVernes%20Text%20Exchange%20and%20Audio%20Leak%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharli-damelio-zoe-laverne-text-audio-leak-html.html&description=Charli%20DAmelio%20and%20Zoe%20LaVernes%20Text%20Exchange%20and%20Audio%20Leak%20Online" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sexiest-90s-stars-bikinis-pics-photos-eg18.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sexiest 90s Stars In Bikinis  PICS  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anna-nicole-smith-howard-stern-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Anna Nicole Smith's partner Howard K Stern and where is he now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
