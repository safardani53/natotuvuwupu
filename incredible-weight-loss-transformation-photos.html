Along with gaining more independence, she was also "stressed, working multiple jobs, and I didn't know what I should be eating." That meant she was grabbing what was easy and convenient on a college budget — a ton of pizza and any food she could get during breaks from her waitressing job. And within about a year, she had gained 180 lbs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I started having a lot of health issues," she told PEOPLE. "My back was hurting all the time. I had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PCOS</a> and I was on the spectrum for pre-diabetes and high blood pressure. I love to ride horses — I have my entire life — and I couldn't anymore. I became super insecure and withdrawn, and I stopped going out with my friends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, her mom and grandma were both following the weight loss program <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Optavia</a> and had dropped 80 and 75 lbs., respectively. They had tried getting her on board for years, and in January 2018, after Hudson finished college, she finally agreed to join the program. Hudson started setting alarms for every 2½-3 hours to remind herself to eat healthy snacks, and swapped out the pizza for ones with cauliflower crust or made Taco Tuesdays with lettuce wraps instead of tortillas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the next two and a half years, Hudson consistently lost weight, eventually dropping 187 lbs. She's now a health coach, and helps people "get healthy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I tell people that before I felt like I had a mental cloud over my head.

She started dieting at age 15, and for years afterward, the New Jerseyan, who has since been diagnosed with a binge eating disorder, would yo-yo back and forth — Migliaccio estimates she's lost and gained a significant amount of weight at least 12 times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her highest weight of 349 lbs., though, came at "the lowest point in my life, when my mom passed away," she told PEOPLE. While caring for her mom, Migliaccio gained 200 lbs., and after a fall in her bathroom, she tore her ACL and meniscus in her right knee. A surgeon said she was too heavy for him to repair the injury, and predicted that she would become a wheelchair-user in a year if she didn't lose weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He did me the biggest favor of my life being blunt like that," she said. "It was what I needed to hear, and that's what turned me around."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Migliaccio started a nutritarian diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts, and didn't cut out any foods, allowing herself to have a cheesesteak or ice cream when the craving struck. That 80/20 split of healthy and more indulgent foods helped her stay on track, along with her friends and her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TOPS</a> (Take Off Pounds Sensibly) weight loss support group. In two years, Migliaccio lost 189 lbs., and didn't even need knee surgery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm finally starting to tap into what makes me happy," she said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ann-wulff-lost-207-lbs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ann Wulff: Lost 207 Lbs.</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy Ann Wulff; Kelsey Lee</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ann Wulff</a> felt like pregnancy was "permission to just eat whatever I wanted," the teacher told PEOPLE. Through three pregnancies, she gained more than 100 lbs. and kept going from there, eventually hitting 360 lbs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I convinced myself that it didn't matter if I ate unhealthily because I was already overweight," she said. "I was busy with a full-time job and three little girls, so did it really matter if I eat the ice cream?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But Wulff started to notice little issues; she lacked the energy to walk the five minutes to the park with her daughters, she had to twist into odd positions just to get the car seatbelt to buckle and she was struggling with constant headaches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was in my mid-30s, and I realized that very quickly that there were going to be things that I absolutely could not do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wulff joined <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>WeightWatchers</a>, paying for a full year upfront, and focused on losing just 5 lbs. at a time to stay motivated. With healthy dinner swaps and walks around her neighborhood, she lost 207 lbs. in just over two years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel so much lighter, and I don't mean physically," she said. "I just have so much more energy, I'm more positive, I'm more likely to put myself out there. I'm a better teacher, a better wife, a better mother. A better everything."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-crystal-benes-lost-201-lbs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Crystal Benes: Lost 201 Lbs.</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Crystal Benes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crystal Benes spent most of her life overweight.

"I had no one else to blame for my poor decisions that led me to being nearly 400 lbs."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But that changed on April 2, 2018, when Benes decided to sign up for a local weight loss program in Fort Wayne, Ind. Over 15 weeks, she dropped 100 lbs. thanks to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>personal trainer</a>, nutrition coaching and regular boot camp classes. But the hardest part, she shared, is when that ended and she had to do it on her own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had to understand that this was no longer a diet, and that it had to become my lifestyle," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Benes kept up her daily workouts and nutrition plan, and by January, just 10 months later, she was down to 175 lbs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My weight-loss journey came at a point in my life where my weight was something I faced every day and led me to a constant state of depression," she said.

The Bronx, N.Y.-based Parker had to accept a lower-paying job with flexible hours so she could take care of her daughter, Kumari, and any money she made went to feeding Kumari healthy meals while she ate $1.25 fried chicken.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was stressed and I think I was going through a bit of postpartum depression without realizing it," she told PEOPLE. "Kumari would be asleep and I would be crying, eating chocolate pudding and drinking Pepsi. I would buy foods that I knew were bad, but they gave me comfort at the time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her weight continued to climb. By the time Kumari turned five, Marsha was up to 290 lbs., had developed high blood pressure and was pre-diabetic. It was Kumari who pushed her mom to lose weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would have headaches from the food and she would say, 'I need you to be healthy, I'm really, really worried about you. Please eat healthy.' I realized that my health was connected to her wellbeing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker started taking kickboxing classes and switched to a healthier diet, drinking green smoothies with Kumari and prioritizing lean proteins like fish, chicken and eggs. That, along with a newfound love of weightlifting, helped Parker lose 155 lbs. She balanced five-days-a-week workouts with her job as an online teacher, Ph.D. classes and homeschooling Kumari.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kumari saved my life," Parker said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lindy-cellucci-lost-150-lbs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lindy Cellucci: Lost 150 Lbs.</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kat Borchart</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After eight years of weighing nearly 300 lbs., <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lindy Cellucci</a> reached her breaking point during a vacation with friends in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's this place called Hopewell Rocks that goes down to the ocean floor, but you have to go down about 500 steps.
