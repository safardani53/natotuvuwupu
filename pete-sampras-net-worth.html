With these coaches’ help, he could develop his current forehand and backhand techniques.</p><p>Afterward, Sampras started appearing in professional tournaments at 16 and quickly began rising to the top and becoming a tennis star. We cannot expect less about the childhood of America’s no one tennis player, can we? Well, not only did he become the no. 1 tennis player in all of America, but he also kept this title for six years!</p><p>The net worth was earned over 14 years through games, endorsement deals, and wise investments.
