Like, right, let’s get everything done.</p><p>“I’ve had a little bit of Botox, some filler – everything I can get done. My face is now like Trigger’s broom from Only Fools And Horses, very little of the original is still there.”</p><p>Jimmy certainly looks very different to how he did when he started out in the early Noughties and the acerbic comedian has always been open about his tweakments to slow the ageing process.</p><p>So, how much has his quest to turn back the hands of time cost him?</p><p>Amar Suchde, founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AMS Aesthetics</a>&nbsp;told The Sun that a large part of his transformation is down to shedding some timber.</p><p>He said: "Jimmy has clearly lost a lot of weight over the years."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Amar added that he believes the comic has regular Botox treatment on his forehead to remove some of his lines to make him look more fresh.</p><p>He added: "There still seems to be some movement which may indicate a smaller dosage such as that&nbsp;used in Baby Botox."</p><h2>Hair transplant</h2><p>Jimmy explained he had the hair transplant procedure after worrying he was beginning to resemble a "snooker-playing vampire".</p><p>Jimmy detailed how the procedure worked, saying: "So what happened was my hair was socially distancing from my forehead and I’d had enough of it.</p><p>"I shaved my head and what they do is take hairs from the back of your head and they put them on the front.</p><p>"Basically I had enough hair, it was just in the wrong place. It was a bit of redistribution."</p><h2>Under-eye fillers and laser treatments</h2><p>Amar said Jimmy wears a considerable amount of make-up on set and in shoots, but believes he's had under eye fillers to slow the signs of ageing.</p><p>He added that he may well have also had fillers in his cheeks to replace any facial fat lost during his weight loss journey.</p><p>"Increasing amounts of men are seeking masculinisation aesthetic treatments; focusing particularly on the jawline, to give it more width and make it more aligned and Jimmy may well have had this treatment," he explained.</p><p>He's done really well to maintain the character of his face</p><span class=quote-credit>Amar Suchde</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>AMS Aesthetics founder</span><p>"His skin looks fantastic and I suspect he’s had a number of laser skin resurfacing treatments to give it that youthful &nbsp;glow.</p><p>"It also looks like he may have had skin tightening treatments and under eye fillers."</p><p>Amar said he believes Jimmy has done really well to "maintain the character" of his face and not take aesthetic treatments too far.</p><p>"Rather, he’s just kept up with little tweakments to maintain a fresh look as he is in the spotlight," he said.</p><p>The specialist reckons the work Jimmy has had done would cost in the region of £1,000 to £3,000.</p><h2>Bright white teeth</h2><p>Harley Street dentist <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dr Anjum Jahan</a> reckons Jimmy has helped combat ageing with some clever dental work.</p><p>She thinks the comedian is likely to have had Chairside Teeth whitening - light-activated whitening - which would set him back around £500-800.</p><p>Dr Jahan said: "This is the most likely option as his teeth are a bright white."</p><p>He may also have opted for veneers which is a layer of material placed over each tooth to protect it from damage.</p><h2>Veneers</h2><p>She said: "It is very difficult to tell whether the veneers are made from composite or porcelain.</p><p>"If they are composite, then the price can range between £250-£500 per tooth.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"If made of porcelain price can be £650-£1000 per tooth."</p><p>Dr Jahan estimated that Jimmy is likely to have had more than £7,000 of dental work done so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/e4522069-3863-4221-b73e-070d34db0f97.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000683545520.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Comic Jimmy Carr shows off new look after secret hair transplant</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhpZmeGdX6UbWajoZ2ixm6vwKupZp6RmLJuwNGapayen6e6osDIqKVmm5%2BouqbAyJxkrK2inLKzxY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html&text=Jimmy%20Carrs%20incredible%20face%20transformation%20as%20he%20says%20%27little%20of%20the%20original%20is%20still%20there%27%20fol&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Jimmy%20Carrs%20incredible%20face%20transformation%20as%20he%20says%20%27little%20of%20the%20original%20is%20still%20there%27%20fol" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Jimmy%20Carrs%20incredible%20face%20transformation%20as%20he%20says%20%27little%20of%20the%20original%20is%20still%20there%27%20fol" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html&title=Jimmy%20Carrs%20incredible%20face%20transformation%20as%20he%20says%20%27little%20of%20the%20original%20is%20still%20there%27%20fol" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-carr-face-transformation-cosmetic-surgery.html&description=Jimmy%20Carrs%20incredible%20face%20transformation%20as%20he%20says%20%27little%20of%20the%20original%20is%20still%20there%27%20fol" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./russell-dickerson-wife-kailey-celebrate-career-highs-growing-family-exclusive-8416920.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Russell Dickerson and Wife Kailey Give Thanks for Simple Joys (Exclusive)">&larr;
