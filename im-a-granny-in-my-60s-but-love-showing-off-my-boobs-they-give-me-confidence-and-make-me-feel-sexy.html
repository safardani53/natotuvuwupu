Now - having vowed to take care of her mind and self - she is an elegant size 12, has 36DD boobs and says she has never felt happier with her body.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000532505732.jpg><p>To put it simply, she is the epitome of ‘aging gracefully.’&nbsp;</p><p>Here, as part of our Going Bust series - which launched to help women feel more confident about their boobs - she talks about how her opinion of her breasts has changed over the years and the importance of older women keeping in tune with their bodies.</p><p>“You’re not going to believe this when I say it, but I started developing breasts when I was in primary school. I remember, it was 1969 and unlike my friends, my body was changing before anyone else but my mum still insisted I wore vests!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“It was embarrassing. As my breasts got bigger, my flimsy vest singlets provided no support so, without my mum’s help, at 13, I saved my pocket money, braved a local department store and bought my first bra.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000532505621.jpg><p>“Talking about your body back then, or the changes that everyone goes through during puberty, just wasn’t the ‘done thing’, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.&nbsp;</p><p>“But for some reason it left me feeling insecure and with low self esteem.&nbsp;</p><p>“While all my friends had ‘cute’ B/C cup chests, I left school wearing 36DD bras which were so ugly.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone seemed to think having big boobs was great but they were out of proportion for my body.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t like being stared at and getting leery looks, even when I was wearing a jumper. They made me feel uncomfortable and I hated them.</p><p>Now I love sexy bras and love wearing tops which show off my shoulders and only a glimpse of cleavage</p><span class=quote-credit>Joanna Chamberlain</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>60</span><p>“Luckily, my husband Patrick, a business analyst, who I met when we worked together loves them and always has.&nbsp;</p><p>“We married in 1981, when I was<strong> </strong>21 and now have two grown up kids together but where the time has gone, I have no idea!&nbsp;</p><p>"But before I met Patrick I always felt uncomfortable with men seeing me naked.</p><p>“I’ve been happily married for 39 years but, while I loved being a mum and a wife, it didn’t do my body any favours. I ended up putting everyone before myself and was constantly trying to please people.&nbsp;</p><p>“Because of this, I slowly gained weight and ended up a size 22 which made my self-esteem hit the floor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000605815809.jpg><p>“I used to look in the mirror and feel larger than a house and out of proportion. I was too embarrassed to go for a bra fitting too so kept wearing my old ones, which were too small and made me look like I have four boobs.</p><p>“It wasn’t until I turned<strong> </strong>51 that I finally decided to focus on me. I relative told me I was fat and it shook me to the core and pushed me to make a change.</p><p>"I lost weight by eating clean, exercising at the gym and went from a size 22 to a size 12 and my boobs went from a size 40EE to 36DD.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was 55 and was asked by the company that helped me lose weight to do a model campaign for them.</p><p>“I’d never done anything like that in my life but seeing the new me, with my slim body and curvy natural breasts in the photos shocked me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000532506222.jpg><p>“I realised my boobs looked great for my age and I should be prouder of them. Then, as more and more modelling jobs came in, three years ago I decided to stop colouring my hair blonde and go grey naturally.</p><p>“The demand for me as a model doubled overnight and I now feel the sexiest I have in years.&nbsp;</p><p>“I love sexy bras and love wearing tops which show off my shoulders and only a glimpse of cleavage.</p><p>“I never expected to feel so good about my breasts in my sixties - it’s totally different to how I felt about them in my twenties.</p><p>“Since being more confident in my skin, I also became active in a breast cancer charity group and helped raise thousands for breast cancer awareness.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to check for breast cancer: The 5 step self exam you can do at home</h3></p><p>There is a five-step self exam you can do at home to check for any changes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Begin by looking in a mirror, facing it with your arms on your hips and your shoulders straight.</p><p>You should be looking for any dimpling, puckering, bulging skin, redness, soreness, a rash or changes in the nipple.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Still looking in the mirror, raise both arms above your head and check for the same changes.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;With your arms still above your head, check for any fluid coming from the nipples.</p><p>This can include milky, yellow or watery fluid, or blood.</p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;While lying down use your opposite hand to check each breast.</p><p>Using a few fingers, keeping them flat and together, go in a small circular motion around your breasts.</p><p>Make sure you feel the entire breast by going top to bottom in these small circles.</p><p>It helps to develop a system or pattern to make sure every inch is covered.</p><p>Use light pressure for the skin and tissue just beneath, medium pressure for the tissue in the middle of your breasts, and firm pressure to feel the tissue at the back, feeling down to your ribcage.</p><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Feel your breasts while either standing or sitting, using the same small circular motions.</p><p>“I think it’s especially important for women over the age of sixty to be aware of breast cancer, have regular mammograms and do self-checks for lumps.</p><p>“One in three women over 70 get breast cancer so the quicker you catch it, the better.</p><p>“It’s taken me a while but I’ve learnt to love my breast and other women should too.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in
