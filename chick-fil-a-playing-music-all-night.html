This prompted her to get out of her bed at 2 am and head over to the restaurant to record just how loud its speaker was.</p><p>She documented her journey, along with her gripes with the chicken chain in a series of TikToks: "I am so mad right now an it is not about a boy. It is two in the morning and I am sitting here listening to the Chick-fil-A music again. The reason I am so mad though is that I called and spoke to someone yesterday who guaranteed me in a very rude way that the music was off."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itsnicolechristine</span></figure><p>However, clearly, this wasn't the case, and Nicole went on to delineate her frustrating experience in dealing with the Chick-fil-A rep about the persistent music playing: "In fact this person said oh is this Nicole who I spoke with last week? Yeah, ma'am the music's been off since then."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She then called out the chain for "gaslighting" her into thinking that the music was off when it clearly wasn't: "Not Chick-fil-A trying to gaslight me. I have ears that I use to hear things with. So, we, together, are gonna take a little trip over to Chick-fil-A."</p><p>The video then cuts to Nicole with glasses on her eyes and the lights are off in her place.</p><p>"Reminder that it's 2 am and they apparently play this music to keep people off of their patio so if I encounter anything sketchy, blame Chick-fil-A." The clip then cuts to her pointing to a digital clock, which reads that it's 2:01 am, "Just so you can see the time now it's 2:01, another minute of my life wasted on this."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nicole's video then cuts to her dancing on camera, "Come on vamanos," before she walks down the steps of her place and outside to head over to the restaurant. "I'm literally so mad right now...just pulled up in my car, yes I drove because it is freezing out...honestly I was a little bit scared about what I would find on this patio."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She continues, "And what I found is the music blasting," she half-sings, "Are y'all ready for this?" she asks, before recording the exterior of the Chick-fil-A restaurant in question, including audio.</p><p>She zooms in on a speaker outside of the restaurant, which is clearly blaring a saxophone version of Feliz Navidad. She records herself dancing to the track, following by another long punch in on a speaker again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When the camera cuts back to her face, it's clear that she no longer finds the joke funny anymore, because someone happened to pull up while she was busting a move to the festive music.</p><p>"Somebody pulled into the parking lot, as I was doing that, and I immediately got in my car and drove away cause I was terrified."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nicole then proceeded to call out the chain for basically ignoring her pleas, highlighting that she has been very patient in attempting to get the chain to stop playing the music at this specific location.</p><p>"I have tried to figure this out in such a kind way, so many times you've taken so many nights of sleep from me and at the end of the day I was essentially yelled at and told that I was crazy."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Upon proving that she wasn't and that the music was indeed being played at odd hours of the night at the restaurant location, she implored Chick-fil-A to listen to her: "So now, will you please turn your overnight music off? Another wasted hour of my dad I will go show this exact video to the manager and I will update you on the response and hopefully the apology."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She capped off her video with her walking back to her place to get some shut eye after venturing outdoors to garner proof that Chick-fil-A wasn't picking up what she was putting down: "Now Chick-fil-A was my ex's favorite restaurant and I'm starting to understand why. He lying," she says into the camera as she covers her face up with a pillow, under a blanket.</p><p>"This is how I'm sleeping tonight y'all. I'll update you tomorrow when I talk to the manager and hopefully he'll be nicer to me after he realizes that I haven't been lying about the stupid music the whole time. Good night."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Folks who saw her saga about the Chick-fil-A speaker had different opinions on the outcome. There were some folks who thought that showing him she was appreciative of his efforts would be a good way to ensure that the music doesn't magically ramp back up in volume: "I would send him a thank you card. Active appreciation will keep him on your side if it happens again," one person wrote.</p><p>Another said: "Take it a step further, if you don’t hear the music tonight go back and thank the manager for helping with the problem."</p><p>While others thought it was overall a lame move on behalf of the restaurant to not make sure they weren't blasting music late at night and bothering everyone in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"'Turned it down 'for you' as though it’s not a public nuisance," one said. another posted: "Why can’t they just turn it off at night"</p><p>How would you react to a fast food restaurant blaring music at odd hours of the night that you could hear from your home? Would you have called the police like some folks suggested?</p><p>Or would you put in some earplugs and just call it a day?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWqr8pmnaKkXZZ6sbjAsqCnn12iwrS1wmaYpaRdo7aotNM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html&text=Woman%20Proves%20to%20Chick-Fil-A%20Manager%20Restaurant%20Is%20Blasting%20Music%20at%202%20AM%20to%20Stop%20Loiterers&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html&title=Woman%20Proves%20to%20Chick-Fil-A%20Manager%20Restaurant%20Is%20Blasting%20Music%20at%202%20AM%20to%20Stop%20Loiterers" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html&title=Woman%20Proves%20to%20Chick-Fil-A%20Manager%20Restaurant%20Is%20Blasting%20Music%20at%202%20AM%20to%20Stop%20Loiterers" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html&title=Woman%20Proves%20to%20Chick-Fil-A%20Manager%20Restaurant%20Is%20Blasting%20Music%20at%202%20AM%20to%20Stop%20Loiterers" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchick-fil-a-playing-music-all-night.html&description=Woman%20Proves%20to%20Chick-Fil-A%20Manager%20Restaurant%20Is%20Blasting%20Music%20at%202%20AM%20to%20Stop%20Loiterers" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./carl-nassib.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carl Nassib">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-summer-i-turned-pretty-similar-shows-to-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Summer I Turned Pretty: Similar Shows to Watch">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
