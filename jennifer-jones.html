One day, her volleyball coach asked her if she wanted to be a volleyballer or curler. She thought for a bit and then chose a curler.</span></p><p><span>Jones started to focus more on curling since then. </span>Jennifer participated in her first Junior Championship in 1990. She was 15 at that time. Her team was coached by her dad, which included her sister in the team.</p><p>Though they didn’t win, it was like a confirmation for Jones that she wanted to do curling and win these tournaments. Shortly, the Curler<span>&nbsp;won three provincial junior championships and a national junior championship.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Getting that perfect shot</span></h3><p><span>In the 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts, Jennifer participated with Cathey Gauthier, Jill Officer, and Cathy Overton.</span></p><p><span>In the competition, Jonas was last to make a shot, and her team was already losing. </span><span>The burden of the win was on her shoulders but the possibility of it happening was very low. To win, she had to shoot perfectly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was a very nerve-wracking situation, but soon it became joy as Jones got that perfect shot, scoring 4 points, and her team won.</span></p><p><span>It was the perfect shot everyone talked about, and people started appreciating and seeing the potential in Jennifer Jones.</span></p><h3><span>The bittersweet curling season</span></h3><p><span>After that perfect shot, Jones got a chance to go to Olympics. First, she was qualified for the Olympic trial and had to win the trial to represent Canada in the Olympics.</span></p><p><span>Jones was in the team with 2000 World Champion, Georgina Wheatcroft but they had a disappointing performance at the trial, and Jones couldn’t make it to the Olympics.</span></p><p><span>She then participated in several other international tournaments but couldn’t win any medals.</span></p><h3><span>The record-setting victory</span></h3><p><span>After a bittersweet curling season, Jennifer proved to everyone who she was. She set on records by winning several awards in national and international tournaments.</span></p><p>The Canadian has also won the Manitoba provincial championship 11 times. Also, Jones has appeared for a total of 16 Tournament of Heart appearances. She had made her debut appearance in 2002.</p><p>Jones is record-setting Curler to make appearances as well as winning the games at the Tournament of Hearts. She has won four gold medals, one silver, and two bronze medals in the tournament.</p><p>Apart from this, she has made six appearances in the World Championships, where she has won four medals.</p><p>Also, the Canadian won two gold medals parting a decade, one in 2008 and the other in 2018. She also won a silver medal in 2015 and bronze in 2011.</p><h3><span>First Olympics appearance and winning gold at Sochi Olympics</span></h3><p><span>Jennifer was making international records, and there were so many expectations for her in the 2013 Olympics.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She initially failed to make it to the Olympics, but this time she passed the Olympic trial and made it to the Olympics.</span></p><p><span>Jennifer and her team remained one of the strongest teams in the game. They paved their way to the semifinals beating Britain and had a face-off with Sweden in the finale.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jennifeer-jone.jpg><p><span>Jones’s team made it to winning the competition and bringing home the long-awaited Olympic gold medal.</span></p><p><span>It was Canada’s second gold medal in Olympic women’s curling after 1998. </span><span>Following her contribution, Jennifer Jones was voted the most outstanding Canadian women’s curler of 2019.</span></p><p><strong><a href=#>Athlete Alex Greenwood’s Bio:</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Partner, Manchester, Salary, Age >></a></strong></p><h2>Personal Life&nbsp;</h2><p><span>Jennifer Jones is married to Brent George Laing.
