In fact, the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pitch Perfect</a>&nbsp;star is super close to her siblings, whom she claims keep her grounded.&nbsp; She has opened up about her family a number of times as she has risen up in fame. When revealing how her unique name came about, she shared that it’s something she and her siblings have in common. “A girl called Rebel sang at their wedding, and that’s where my name came from,” she said according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. “My three siblings and I all have middle names after English royalty. Mine is Elizabeth, which is what I was known as at school.” With that said, meet the&nbsp;Bridesmaids&nbsp;star’s three siblings!</p><h2><strong>Liberty Wilson</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rebel-wilson-siblings-mega-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Liberty </strong><strong>Wilson </strong>is the second oldest sibling in the Wilson family after Rebel. Born in 1982, she’s just two years younger than Rebel so naturally, the two were close. She also is big into following family traditions. All of Rebel’s siblings have unique names. In fact, Liberty was named after one of her parents’ favorite department stores. “I’ve really grown to love the fact I have an unusual name… I wanted to keep that tradition going,” Liberty said while testifying for her sister back in 2015 during <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rebel’s defamation case.</a> She was going to name her daughter Disney but after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rebel</a> was accused of claiming she was related to the animator, decided against it. “She (my daughter) does some baby modeling and for that she uses the name Sovereign Wilson,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She doesn’t lead as much of a life in the spotlight as his sister but she does have a TV presence. She competed on Season 1 of The Amazing Race Australia&nbsp;along with her and Rebel’s brother <strong>Ryot Wilson.&nbsp; </strong>On the show, she revealed that she also follows her family’s tradition of dog breeding and handling. “Our family has bred and shown beagles for five generations, and it’s something I absolutely love to do,” Liberty explained during a confessional. She also gave a glimpse into life at home at the Wilson house. “There’s four kids in our family and when we were growing up our mom and dad always encouraged plenty of debate, opinions and laughs around the dinner table. We’re all outspoken,” Liberty said of Rebel and her siblings when competing on the show.</p><h2><strong>Ryot Wilson</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Ryot Wilson&nbsp;</strong>is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rebel’s</a> one and only brother! He got to show off his competitive side to the world when he competed on Season 1 of The Amazing Race Australia&nbsp;along with his and Rebel’s sister Liberty Wilson. During a confessional on the show, he revealed his very unique profession. “I’m a professional poker player. I play full time,” he shared. His sister Liberty also attributed some admirable and not-so-admirable to her brother. “Ryot is very competitive. He’s pretty intelligent. He’s one of the most arrogant people I’ve come across,” she shared, to which Ryot replied, “I would agree with that; I am intelligent.”</p><h2><strong>Annachi Wilson</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rebel-wilson-siblings-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Annachi Wilson&nbsp;</strong>is the baby of the Wilson family! She was born as Annalise but prefers to be called Annachi, similar to Anarchy. She was also lovingly called “on the leash” by her siblings as a nod to her parents’ involvement in the dog industry, which was revealed during Rebel’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defamation trial.</a> Like Rebel, she keeps her social media public to give fans a glimpse into her fun and adventurous lifestyle. She often uploads some sweet snaps of her and her siblings. She has proved that she and Rebel are close as they often spend time together whether it’s by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>working out</a> by the Sydney Opera House, going to Disney together or celebrating the Rams’ victory at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Super Bowl.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9GemZ6kXay2rb%2FOp6pmq5mXuaq6xqxkbW5mZoN1fo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html&text=Meet%20Her%202%20Sisters%20%26amp%3b%20Brother%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html&title=Meet%20Her%202%20Sisters%20%26amp%3b%20Brother%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html&title=Meet%20Her%202%20Sisters%20%26amp%3b%20Brother%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html&title=Meet%20Her%202%20Sisters%20%26amp%3b%20Brother%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frebel-wilsons-siblings-4661642.html&description=Meet%20Her%202%20Sisters%20%26amp%3b%20Brother%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paris-jackson-red-lace-bra-mini-skirt-lacoste-event-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paris Jacksons Red Lace Bra &amp;amp; Mini Skirt Lacoste Event: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./justin-bieber-mom-foot-massage-video-pattie-mallette.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Bieber Gives Mom A Foot Massage  See Video Of Pattie Mallette  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
