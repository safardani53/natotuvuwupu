I put them in a big suitcase and off I went.</p><p>“There’s still one sweater I wear much to my wife Gill’s chagrin. She hates it and I love it.</p><p>“She says I should give it to charity and I say no, it’s my memories of Fools and Horses. I’ll tell you what I’ve also got, that big sheepskin coat that Del wore right at the beginning.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on David Jason">Read More on David Jason</h2><p>“Unfortunately, I can’t wear that because it’s too loud but I love it.”<br>David has now written his fourth memoir, The Twelve Dels Of Christmas, where he candidly speaks about his life experiences as well as the highs of playing the popular character.</p><p>Filming the show was a delight for him and the rest of the cast, which included <a href=#>Nicholas Lyndhurst</a> as Rodney Trotter and the late <a href=#>Lennard Pearce</a> as Grandad.</p><p>He says: “Part of the fun of doing Fools And Horses was not only that the script was so good and brilliantly funny, the people cast in the other roles like Boycie (John Challis) and Marlene (Sue Holderness) were so good, funny, and such fun to be with.”</p><p><a href=#>David and Nick, 61,</a> had a reputation for being the ultimate pranksters — they once incensed Lennard when they pinned his shoes to the floor.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>But another joke was so expensive that the other cast and crew believed it would spell the end of the show.</p><p><a href=#>David</a> explains: “One day, Nick and I were in our very small caravan on location.</p><p>We were all fed up because nothing was happening so Nick and I said ‘Why don’t we stage a huge row and you can storm out and say you’re leaving and I can shout at you saying don’t you ever come back again. I never want to work with you’.”</p><p>After working out a script between them, they put their plan into action and howled that they would never work together again.</p><p><a href=#>Sir David</a> adds: “You can imagine what it was like when we said that. The whole crew went stiff. Five minutes went by and the producer and director came to see me and they were quaking in their boots.</p><p>“They asked what’s going on and I told them to go see Nick. I followed them out and when they got to him, I couldn’t contain myself any longer and roared with laughter.</p><p>“They went from white to purple in their faces. I don’t think the producer was much impressed.”</p><p>And while many fans have spent decades begging for the show’s comeback, <a href=#>Sir David</a> says he and creator and writer <a href=#>John Sullivan</a>, who died in 2011, once toyed with the idea of making a film.</p><p>He explained: “I think the company that wanted us to make that film was the same that made the Carry On films. They were very popular and I suppose quite successful. But John and I were not that impressed because they were made quite cheaply.</p><p>“Although they were successful and funny, they didn’t look like they were made in Hollywood, did they?</p><p>“So we turned it down. And that was the only time we ever considered doing that. It wasn’t given the ideology that it would have some class about it, let me put it that way.”</p><p>When I was first asked to read the script, I said to my agent at the time that this was going to be something special. It was not a situation comedy. It was like a situation drama.</p><span class=quote-credit>Sir David Jason</span><p>Although some of the stars have sadly passed away, including <a href=#>John Challis</a>, who <a href=#>died of cancer</a> last year, would <a href=#>Sir David</a> ever reunite the cast for one last outing?</p><p>“Don’t tempt me, Satan, get back downstairs where you belong,” he quips comically.</p><p>“I don’t think so. Basically, the only person I would trust with the script would have been John and because he’s no longer with us, I don’t think anyone comes up to his standard.”</p><p>Throughout the book, <a href=#>Sir David</a> talks about his gratitude for <a href=#>John Sullivan</a>, who changed his life with the show.</p><p>He explains: “When I was first asked to read the script, I said to my agent at the time that this was going to be something special. It was not a situation comedy. It was like a situation drama.</p><p>“I honestly felt that it was so rich in its ability in storytelling and entertainment and it was different from anything I had seen before.</p><p>“I went to the interview with Nick and Lennard and crossed my fingers that I would get it.</p><p>“I was pretty certain it would make a series but I had no idea it would take off like it did. It was a surprise to all of us, I’m very pleased to say, of course.”</p><p>Since the show wrapped in 2003, it has often found itself at the top of many polls of the <a href=#>greatest British sitcoms</a> ever made.</p><p><a href=#>Sir David</a> says: “One of the greatest things that give me pleasure about the success is — I know because I’ve been to those Only Fools and Horses conventions — is how much pleasure it has given to many people.”</p><p>Part of the fun of doing Fools And Horses was not only that the script was so good and brilliantly funny, the people cast in the other roles like Boycie (John Challis) and Marlene (Sue Holderness) were so good, funny, and such fun to be with.</p><span class=quote-credit>Sir David Jason</span><p>Although it was his breakout role, <a href=#>the North London-born star</a> has led a remarkable career spanning nearly 60 years and seen him collect three <a href=#>Baftas</a>, <a href=#>National Television Awards</a> and, of course, a <a href=#>knighthood</a>.</p><p>He listed what he believes has been the best sitcoms has starred in throughout his illustrious career.</p><p>He says: “In no particular order, it would have to be Porterhouse Blue, I don’t think they’ve ever repeated that so probably not a lot of people remember that.</p><p>"But also, A Touch of Frost would be amongst those and also Darling Buds of May and Open All Hours.”</p><p>On whether he would like to try out his luck on newer shows such as <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a>, <a href=#>Sir David</a> revealed he’s been asked to be on the show.</p><p>He says: “Look, I enjoy my work and I love entertaining people. That’s part of my driving force.</p><p>“But listen, I know my limitations. If you asked me to go on Strictly 30 years ago I would have leapt at it. But no, I don’t want to make a fool of myself.”</p><p>David was keen to offer advice to upcoming sitcom stars: “You’ve really got to enjoy and love the shows that you’re doing.</p><p>“It’s not about being grand. It’s about giving yourself to your audience and making them laugh.</p><p>“That’s the most important thing I’ve learned over the years.”</p><ul><li><strong>The Twelve Dels of Christmas by David Jason, is published by Penguin and is out now</strong></li></ul><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Play it cool</h2><p>SIR DAVID’S portrayal of <a href=#>Del Boy</a> endeared the character to viewers and made him one of the greatest figures in British culture.</p><p>A poll commissioned by <a href=#>Channel 4</a> named <a href=#>Del Boy</a> as the fourth greatest TV character out of a 100 names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lmk112-49161-220714-www-lmkmedia-227996026.jpg><p>And now a new poll conducted by TV channel GOLD, has voted <a href=#>Del Boy</a> falling through the bar in the episode Yuppy Love as the greatest TV moment ever.</p><p>In the iconic scene, broadcast in January 1989, the ever confident loveable rogue is intent on showing Trigger how to chat up “modern Euro birds”.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Leaning on a bar flap</a>, he briefly moves away to point out some women to Trigger and is unaware his perch has been lifted out of place by a bartender.</p><p>When he returns to lean back on it, he falls straight through with Trigger looking around for him, and noting that he’s “disappeared.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/37b67bb3-05ba-4585-90d6-0d0e34d860ed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/david-jason-publicity-picture-772027702.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpgZ4Vxg5VuZp2Zpp6xbrbArKanZZSauW6uzrJknKSfqbWmv4yopaWxXZu8sLjSZpinnF2dvLO%2FxKxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html&text=I%20still%20wear%20Del%20Boy%27s%20clothes%20but%20there%27s%20a%20classic%20look%20I%27d%20never%20repeat%2c%20says%20Only%20Fools%20and%20Hors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=I%20still%20wear%20Del%20Boy%27s%20clothes%20but%20there%27s%20a%20classic%20look%20I%27d%20never%20repeat%2c%20says%20Only%20Fools%20and%20Hors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=I%20still%20wear%20Del%20Boy%27s%20clothes%20but%20there%27s%20a%20classic%20look%20I%27d%20never%20repeat%2c%20says%20Only%20Fools%20and%20Hors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html&title=I%20still%20wear%20Del%20Boy%27s%20clothes%20but%20there%27s%20a%20classic%20look%20I%27d%20never%20repeat%2c%20says%20Only%20Fools%20and%20Hors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-jason-del-boy-clothes-only-fools-and-horses.html&description=I%20still%20wear%20Del%20Boy%27s%20clothes%20but%20there%27s%20a%20classic%20look%20I%27d%20never%20repeat%2c%20says%20Only%20Fools%20and%20Hors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./matty-cranmer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matty Cranmer">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maurice-sam.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Maurice Sam net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
