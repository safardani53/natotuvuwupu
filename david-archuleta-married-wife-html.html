Afterward, he shared that&nbsp;he was looking for someone who loved the Lord even more than she would love him.</p><p>Obviously, I don't know if it's cheesy, but I think&nbsp;someone needs to love the Lord. It's a given; they need to love the Lord more than they love me.</p><p>Archuleta also listed that he wanted someone confident,&nbsp;sure of themselves, carries themselves well, and&nbsp;someone fun to be with.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>When he was asked if his wife needed to be a singer like him, he stated that it wouldn't matter to him. But meanwhile, he wanted her to be supportive of what he did. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The 30-year-old singer also mentioned that it would be beautiful to have someone with virtue, and he could learn from her.</p><p>"You can look at them and tell 'that's someone who gets what virtue is,'" he said. "And what is virtue? When I think of virtue, I think of the temple. Something clean and pure. Someone who strives to live their lives that way. It just makes all the difference."</p><p>And while he was answering all those questions, he was single and had no&nbsp;girlfriend at that time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Current Relationship Status</h2><p>Archuleta is&nbsp;very private about his <a href=# rel=follow>personal life</a>, which keeps his love life under wraps. But he is&nbsp;reportedly single presently.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the early days of his career, he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">linked</a> to dating several divas from the glamour world. The list includes&nbsp;actress Fernanda Andrade, singer Jordan Pruitt, musical artist Jackie Castro, and actress Hagood Coxe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Archuleta’s Tweet Perceived to Be Anti-gay</h2><p>In 2010, Archuleta was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> to be gay after he walked into a gay bar. But later, he cleared the rumors stating, he had gay friends, and he was there to see his friends. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"I have friends who are gay, and they're great people," he said.</p><p>Four years later, things changed, as the singer was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">perceived</a> to be anti-gay.</p><p>The singer-songwriter sparked the controversy when he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>&nbsp;a quote from the Mormon Church. The tweet was considered anti-gay, as it stated that love could only be expressed between a man and a woman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Romantic love is incomplete. It is a prelude. Love is nourished by the coming of children, who spring from the fountain of love…expressed between a man and a woman in marriage. #PresPacker</p><p>Later, the 'Crush' singer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apologized </a>for offending others with the quote he shared. He expressed that his intentions were misunderstood.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His Rise to Fame</h2><p>Archuleta first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rose</a> to fame after taking the runner-up spot in season seven of American Idol in&nbsp;2007. The show gave him a boost to release new songs.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The following year, the songwriter released his first single, 'Crush,' from his debut album. His song <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hit</a> the number two spot on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Billboard Hot 100&nbsp;</a>list in May the following year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His first Christmas album&nbsp;Christmas from the Heart, was released in&nbsp;October 2008. This album peaked at number two on the&nbsp;US Holiday Album Charts. Following that, in&nbsp;October 2010, his second studio album,&nbsp;The Other Side of Down,&nbsp;was released. It reached number thirteen on the&nbsp;US Billboard 200 Charts. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnlJbDqrCMmqmcoKWhsrWtjKaYq6qZmrFuw8ifnGegpKK5</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html&text=Singer%20David%20Archuleta%20Wants%20Supportive%20and%20Virtuous%20Wife%20%20But%20Who%27s%20He%20Dating%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html&title=Singer%20David%20Archuleta%20Wants%20Supportive%20and%20Virtuous%20Wife%20%20But%20Who%27s%20He%20Dating%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html&title=Singer%20David%20Archuleta%20Wants%20Supportive%20and%20Virtuous%20Wife%20%20But%20Who%27s%20He%20Dating%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html&title=Singer%20David%20Archuleta%20Wants%20Supportive%20and%20Virtuous%20Wife%20%20But%20Who%27s%20He%20Dating%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-archuleta-married-wife-html.html&description=Singer%20David%20Archuleta%20Wants%20Supportive%20and%20Virtuous%20Wife%20%20But%20Who%27s%20He%20Dating%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-summer-i-turned-pretty-similar-shows-to-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Summer I Turned Pretty: Similar Shows to Watch">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./star-tracks-thursday-november-24-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daniel Craig, Kate Hudson, Emily Ratajkowski [PHOTOS]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
