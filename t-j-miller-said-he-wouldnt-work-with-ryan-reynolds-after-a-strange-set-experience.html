Miller, an American comedian, has said that he is unwilling to work with Ryan Reynolds after having a “strange” meeting with him on a movie set.&nbsp;During an appearance on the Adam Corolla Show podcast, the 41-year-old celebrity said that he “got along with [Reynolds] a lot better on the first Deadpool because he wasn’t a great, massive movie star,” but that things changed following the superhero film’s amazing popularity.</p><p>TJ Miller, who portrays Weasel in the series, remembered an incident on the set of the film in which Ryan Reynolds reportedly urged the director to take another shot in order to humiliate the comic in front of the crew.</p><p>“On Deadpool, we had a pretty strange moment when he said, ‘Let’s do one more take.'” And then, as the role, he was really cruel to me. But not to me. As if I were Weasel. He said, ‘You know what I love about you, Weasel? You’re not the star, but you do just enough exposition to make it hilarious, and then we can go back to the actual movie.”</p><p>Miller described the punch as “strange,” adding that as he stepped off the stage following the shot, he saw the crew was also uneasy.</p><p>Miller noted that although he liked Reynolds “as a comic,” he would not work with him again.</p><p>“Would I collaborate with him again?” No, I would not collaborate with him again. But I’ve already stated that about Michael Bay, and we’re now friends, and I’d work with him again. But I believe Michael Bay is unique.”</p><h2>Everything you need to know about T.J. Miller</h2><p>T.J. Miller was born in Denver, Colorado on June 4, 1981. He is the son of attorney Kent Miller and clinical psychologist Leslie Miller. According to his IMDb page, he received his elementary schooling in Washington, D.C. before continuing his studies in England and France.&nbsp;He relocated to Chicago and started playing with independent improvisation groups.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/T.J.-Miller.jpg alt="T.J. Miller" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Miller made her television debut on The Standard Deviants, a PBS show aimed at offering educational DVDs and programs to schools. He played both the role of a knight and a dinosaur investigator.&nbsp;Following his appearance as Marmaduke Brooker in the television series Carpoolers, he went on to star in a number of other films and television series, including The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard, She’s Out of My League, Get Him to the Greek, Gulliver’s Travels, Our Idiot Brother, Rock of Ages, RVC: The Lone Shopping Network, The Goodwin Games, Jason Nash Is Married, Underwater, and others.</p><h2>Ryan Reynolds was described as “insecure” by T.J. Miller.</h2><p>T.J. Miller added in the same podcast interview that he never talked to Ryan Reynolds about the alleged event but has no ill will toward the Deadpool series, which is presently in the pre-production stage of its third sequel. T.J. Miller said that he had no intention of returning to the brand after labeling Ryan “sort of an insecure person.”</p><p>“I would not have done Deadpool 3 if they said, ‘We want you to do Deadpool 3, and we’re going to pay you twice as much.'” I believe he should do a Deadpool 3 and keep making movies. I simply believe he doesn’t like me, and I felt he said it strangely. I’m at a point in my life where I don’t feel the urge to see Deadpool 3.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ryan-Reynolds.jpg alt="Ryan Reynolds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>T.J. Miller’s career in the entertainment business has been marred by scandal. A woman who attended college with him accused him of s*xual assault in 2017. He disputed the charges. In 2018, he was fired from Silicon Valley after allegedly bullying a fellow actor on the set.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirZqJdoratuMSrZKyZmZl6qbGMsKaupJSjwW7DzquiZq%2BZqbVuvtiapWaqla67sLjDrGSanqSav26tjKyrq5menLJuv8StZJ6woJq%2FqrHNnJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html&text=T.J.%20Miller%20Said%20He%20Wouldnt%20Work%20With%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20After%20A%20Strange%20Set%20Experience&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html&title=T.J.%20Miller%20Said%20He%20Wouldnt%20Work%20With%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20After%20A%20Strange%20Set%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html&title=T.J.%20Miller%20Said%20He%20Wouldnt%20Work%20With%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20After%20A%20Strange%20Set%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html&title=T.J.%20Miller%20Said%20He%20Wouldnt%20Work%20With%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20After%20A%20Strange%20Set%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ft-j-miller-said-he-wouldnt-work-with-ryan-reynolds-after-a-strange-set-experience.html&description=T.J.%20Miller%20Said%20He%20Wouldnt%20Work%20With%20Ryan%20Reynolds%20After%20A%20Strange%20Set%20Experience" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./troy-balderson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Troy Balderson">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shoppers-raving-teddy-fleece-reversible-mattress-topper-sale.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shoppers are raving about a teddy fleece reversible mattress topper that is on sale for just 11">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
