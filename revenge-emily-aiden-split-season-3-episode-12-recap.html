You guys, Nolan’s just the best. He tried to find out when Emily would be fighting back against the Graysons, but unfortunately, Emily was not having it. She didn’t want to take part in anymore revenge; she just wanted out of the Hamptons, which is understandable — but Emily didn’t stay that way for long!</p><h3><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Shocker: Did The Show Just Ruin Emily’s Happy Ending?</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>In order to keep a closer eye on her new daughter-in-law, Victoria (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madeleine Stowe</strong></a>) had Emily moved to Grayson Manor, directly under her care. As if Emily’s life could get any worse.</p><h3>We’ve Got A Niko Problem</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Last week’s episode revealed that Niko (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stephanie Jacobsen</strong></a>) was an old romantic acquaintance of Aiden’s (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Barry Sloane</strong></a>), and Emily/Aiden fans everywhere shed a tear. This week, Niko continued to help Aiden by watching over Emily — but first, Aiden was safe to admit that he and Emily had reconnected.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Despite this revelation, Niko followed Emily to Grayson Manor and revealed herself as Takeda’s daughter. Emily wallowed a bit more… until Niko punched her! She pumped her up by saying that the pain she was feeling is what the Graysons did to her. Niko also added a jealous bit about Takeda spending more time with Emily than with his own daughter. Ouch!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What Aiden had forgotten to mention was that he had promised he would return with Niko to Japan. (Wait, what about Emily?) Also, being around so much revenge talk inspired her to want to avenge her father’s death. I wonder what she’ll do when she finds out Aiden did the murderous deed!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>That’s when Niko and Aiden kissed, and he seemed to forget all about Emily. (I do not like this. Not at all.)</p><h3>Love Is A Nasty Thing</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>While Emily was recovering, Daniel stopped by The Stowaway to check on Sarah (<strong>Annabelle Stephenson</strong>). Apparently, she didn’t try to kill herself; she just got drunk and fell asleep in the bathtub. The room got a little heated between the two lovers, so Jack (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Wechsler</strong></a>) punched Daniel! I have to think that it was because he shot Emily and not because of Sarah.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Meanwhile, Patrick (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>) continued to be in love with his mother and prove his loyalty to her. Victoria wanted Emily’s infinity box from Nolan’s house, so she admitted that Daniel shot Emily, but when Patrick wanted to go through with Operation Infinity Box, Victoria was not having it. An angry Patrick said he gave up Nolan for her, yet he still didn’t have her confidence. “I guess you’ll choose your blood over your bastard,” Patrick said. Victoria slapped her eldest son — and it was a nasty one.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Patrick went through with his plan and batted his eyelashes at Nolan for a date. During their date, Patrick attempted to inebriate Nolan, especially after Nolan confessed he was a lightweight. But when Patrick spilled the drinks on Nolan’s arm, then licked it up — yes, you read that right — he discovered it was only water! Nolan said he only started drinking H2O when he realized Patrick was up to something. Unfortunately, Nolan was right, but Patrick knocked him out before he could do anything.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The infinity box was found and Patrick handed it over to Victoria. (I was right about Patrick all along!)</p><span>New ‘Revenge’ Promo</span><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h3>There’s Something About Daniel</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Charlotte (<strong>Christa B. Allen</strong>) actually did something of use and brought Jack and Carl to see Emily. Jack, being the moral compass of the show, didn’t understand why Emily didn’t turn Daniel in. Emily said she needed time to escape and hopefully one day start a family of her own. Jack gave Carl’s stuffed animal to Emily, and it was adorable, but the puppy turned out to be a phone for Nolan! Very clever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Victoria eventually confronted Emily and told her she was never pregnant, nor could she ever get pregnant. Ouch! Once Victoria got the Infinity Box, it only added fuel to her fire. Emily remained cool and still proclaimed to only love Daniel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>But where was all the stuff about Amanda Clarke? These are things I need to know.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Over in Montauk, Jack told Margaux (<strong>Karine Vanasse</strong>) that it wasn’t Lydia (<strong>Amber Valletta</strong>) who shot Emily, but Daniel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>However, when Emily called the press and admitted it was Lydia who shot her and that the newlyweds were offering a $10 million reward for her capture, Margaux got pissed. All the Graysons, meanwhile, were shocked and relieved.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Emily, Daniel, and Victoria also sat down for an epic chit-chat. She confessed that she knew Daniel shot her, and was now concerned with how they would move forward. Daniel was totally against this idea, but Emily said with a sinister smirk, “I like the lifestyle. I’m not going anywhere.” Daniel replied, “Screw you.” Their marriage seems to be on the right track — not!</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Let’s hope Emily can get her footing on her next plan of revenge action. I miss strong and fierce Emily!</p><p id=content-paragraph-19><strong>— Avery Thompson</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @avery__thompson</a></p><h3>More ‘Revenge’ On HollywoodLife.com:</h3><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Recap: Emily Reveals Her True Identity</a></li><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Recap: Emily’s Shooter Revealed On Midseason Finale</a></li><li><a href=#>‘Revenge’ Recap: A Romantic Proposal Changes Everything</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH1ye5BsZqudppq7qLGMnqSipKlirqqwxKdkrKicnsFuv8SaqqimXWh6przIrKadnV1mf26%2BxJyYqWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html&text=Emily%20%26amp%3b%20Aiden%20Split%20%20Season%203%20Episode%2012%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html&title=Emily%20%26amp%3b%20Aiden%20Split%20%20Season%203%20Episode%2012%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html&title=Emily%20%26amp%3b%20Aiden%20Split%20%20Season%203%20Episode%2012%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html&title=Emily%20%26amp%3b%20Aiden%20Split%20%20Season%203%20Episode%2012%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frevenge-emily-aiden-split-season-3-episode-12-recap.html&description=Emily%20%26amp%3b%20Aiden%20Split%20%20Season%203%20Episode%2012%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gary-cahill.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Cahill">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anna-duggar-was-involved-in-joshs-cellphone-scheme-is-still-mad-at-him-for-getting-caught-report.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anna Duggar Was Involved In Josh's Cellphone Scheme, Is Still Mad at Him For Getting Caught [Report]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
