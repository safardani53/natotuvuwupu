He works really hard and does a lot for our family.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked what he would like for Father’s Day this year, Brodrick, 36, jokes “I don’t know, maybe another kidney.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lance and Brodrick are still recovering at home from the May 24 transplant at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, which has the largest pediatric transplant program in the country.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The average recovery time is four to six weeks and both were still feeling a little fatigued and sore 20 days post-surgery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Regardless of the side effects, I want to provide him a life. It was a no-brainer,” says Brodrick, who works as an operations manager for Ryder System, Inc. “I was out of the hospital the next day and walking. I think everybody was really surprised at how quickly I recovered.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brodrick and Lance Hubbard.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>courtesy texas children's hospital/the hubbard family</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The father of three says his middle son has endured a lot to get to this place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He’s very strong,” Brodrick says. “I knew if anybody was able to overcome it, it would be him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>My Extraordinary Family</a>&nbsp;is PEOPLE's new series that explores fascinating families in all their forms.

We believe in God and I always felt we had whatever tools necessary to correct the issues that were going on.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Hubbard brothers, Lebron, Lance, and Karter, at home in 2020.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>the hubbard family</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now instead of navigating a life filled with medications, hemodialysis and restrictions, he can finally think about playing a rousing game with his basketball-loving dad and brothers LeBron, 16 and Karter, 7.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I want to play basketball without my mom being worried and I want to play without getting tired,” Lance says.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidneys are the unsung heroes of the body, providing a special filter system removing waste products, toxins and fluids. They also help control levels of calcium, phosphorus and potassium as well as controlling blood pressure and production of red blood cells.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But when they begin shutting down, patients must endure an incredibly strict diet to help relieve the burden on the failing organs. Foods with high potassium, phosphorous and salt – think no chips and salsa or even spinach – are out. And liquids are cut to about 32 oz a day. Dialysis, a poor replacement for the natural organs, will eventually take over, leaving patients unable to urinate on their own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The doctors take away their food and limit their drinking,” mom Kendria, 35, says. “So it was very difficult for Lance to maintain a normal life.”<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Lance and Karter playing video games after the successful transplant.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>the hubbard family</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not that he didn’t make an effort to do so. He played on his school’s football team as a defensive end last fall. But when he started dialysis in September, his symptoms got worse. It is not unusual to develop “brain fog” as a result of the toxins not being completely removed by dialysis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lance’s grades started to dwindle a little bit because he was not able to concentrate, Kendria says. He would say often that the teacher would be giving lectures and he could not pay attention and he was not able to always formulate certain thoughts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And then some meds make him a little jittery,” Kendria says. “So school was not fun at all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He eventually left school prior to his transplant.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brodrick, Lance and Kendria Hubbard.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>courtesy texas children's hospital/the hubbard family</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There was never a doubt in Brodrick’s mind that when the time came for him to donate a kidney to his son, he would gladly do that. With support from Kendria, he lost about 15 lbs. and got into shape for his operation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Lance has only had a short time with his new kidney, he’s enjoying things most take for granted: Drinking as much water as he wants and eating roast beef. “I ate an entire bag of tacos,” he adds.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He looks forward to starting high school this fall, spending time outside with friends and family and going crawfishing (“Crawfish boils are really big in my family”).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his gift to his dad for Father’s Day, he’s planning on cooking breakfast in bed and giving him a promise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ll take my anti-rejection medications and remain hydrated to preserve my kidney as long as possible and make my dad proud," he adds.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5SWsW6zwK%2BcZqufo3qstcOnnLJllpbBqbHRrGSdmaliurp5xLGrq5mfp7GqusCrsGaekaK2rcWMcGxtb2Zshg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html&text=It%27s%20a%20Special%20Father%27s%20Day%20for%20Dad%20Who%20Gave%20Son%20a%20Kidney&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html&title=It%27s%20a%20Special%20Father%27s%20Day%20for%20Dad%20Who%20Gave%20Son%20a%20Kidney" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html&title=It%27s%20a%20Special%20Father%27s%20Day%20for%20Dad%20Who%20Gave%20Son%20a%20Kidney" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html&title=It%27s%20a%20Special%20Father%27s%20Day%20for%20Dad%20Who%20Gave%20Son%20a%20Kidney" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdad-gave-son-kidney-fathers-day-my-extraordinary-family-7547679.html&description=It%27s%20a%20Special%20Father%27s%20Day%20for%20Dad%20Who%20Gave%20Son%20a%20Kidney" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./margarida-corceiro-20021026-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Margarida Corceiro (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hohomi-vg7y-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="hohomi (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
