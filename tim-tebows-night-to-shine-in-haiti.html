Sure, there are flowers, dancing and candy hearts – but it’s just not a romantic holiday. The love goes deeper than that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s the kickoff of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Night to Shine</a> – a worldwide simultaneous prom event for people with special needs. The numbers are staggering for an event in its second year: last weekend, there were 200 events in 48 states and 7 countries: the U.S., Uganda, Haiti, New Zealand, Ecuador, Kenya and the Philippines.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More than 32,000 people with special needs attended one of the proms, which were staffed by more than 70,000 volunteers. Directors of the the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tim Tebow Foundation</a> had worked nonstop to plan every detail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Night to Shine is a big deal for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>former NFL quarterback</a> and current SEC Network analyst. “We work towards this all year,” he says. “Our whole point – our whole reason for doing this – is to show these people that they matter. They matter to me. They matter to people who love them. They matter to God.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Celebrating the Marginalized</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While most of the proms took place on February 12, the one in Haiti was scheduled for the previous evening at the campus of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>My Life Speaks,</a> an American-run organization that provides orphan care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marginalized and disabled children and teens came from all over the country to attend the event – perhaps the first time in their lives they’d ever been celebrated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s just so important to me,” Tebow, 28, says. “I’ve always had a burden for people who can’t fight for themselves. The disabled are often bullied and told in a million ways that they’re not important. Well, they are important, and this is a night for them to realize that they are important – and for the community to actually see them and celebrate them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As if to reinforce his point, people from the nearby village stood outside, looking quizzically through the windows at the event. They watched all night as people with severe disabilities were honored.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There are people who look at the disabled as being cursed,” Tebow says. “But they’re now watching them being celebrated. I hope that can change the narrative, not just in Haiti, but everywhere.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>A Night to Remember</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a hot, muggy night in Haiti. Recent rains had made the dirt roads muddy, and standing water added to the area’s mosquito problem. Girls arrived at the prom in formal gowns caked with mud at the bottom. Boys wore suits and ties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the participants walked along the red carpet, volunteers – including Tebow – stood nearby, cheering for them. “It’s probably the first time many of them have been applauded,” Tebow explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the Haitian participants, Tebow’s presence wasn’t the big deal that it might have been in America. They knew little about his football career. And that was just fine by Tebow. “This is their night, not mine,” he says. “It should be about celebrating them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And celebrate they did. There were areas where the girls could choose clothes and get their hair done. Caregivers were pampered too, with an exclusive lounge for them to relax while volunteers kept an eye on the participants. Plates of food were served.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the high point of the night was the crowning. Unlike a standard prom where one king and queen is crowned, everyone gets a crown or a tiara at a Night to Shine event. They beamed as the crowns were placed upon their heads.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And then came the dancing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some of the dancers had Down Syndrome. Others used wheelchairs. One boy – who was a really good dancer – was deaf, and moved along with the vibrations of the pounding bass.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By now, darkness had fallen, but the party continued. Tebow stayed longer than expected. “It was just too much fun to leave,” he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the participants had a fantastic night, so did Tebow. In the SUV ride back to the airport, he reflected on Night to Shine, an event that he hopes will continue for many years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was so powerful,” he tells PEOPLE. “We weren’t just throwing a party; we were celebrating life. We’re not in this just to throw parties. We’re in this to show people that they’re special, they’re loved, and that God has a plan for their lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re in it so that people, no matter their needs, understand that they matter. They’re not cursed at all. They are very blessed, and we were blessed to be able to celebrate them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeknrpuwMSbprCrXaO2qLTTZquoZaOdtq%2BxjKKlZqCRnsGqew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html&text=Tim%20Tebow%27s%20Night%20to%20Shine%20in%20Haiti&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html&title=Tim%20Tebow%27s%20Night%20to%20Shine%20in%20Haiti" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html&title=Tim%20Tebow%27s%20Night%20to%20Shine%20in%20Haiti" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html&title=Tim%20Tebow%27s%20Night%20to%20Shine%20in%20Haiti" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftim-tebows-night-to-shine-in-haiti.html&description=Tim%20Tebow%27s%20Night%20to%20Shine%20in%20Haiti" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jim-mcmahon-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jim McMahon Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nia-jax-posts-empowering-swimsuit-selfie-w475974.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nia Jax Posts Empowering Swimsuit Selfie">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
