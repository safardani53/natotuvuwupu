However, another report from The Guardian claimed otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda's Ethnicity Came with a Surprising Story</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Guardian</a>, Miranda's ancestry piqued the interest of a leading genealogist,&nbsp;Megan Smolenyak, who studied the actor's family tree for months before she landed on a particularly touching story.&nbsp;</p><p>Smolenyak, whose other subjects have included <a href=# rel=follow>Barack and&nbsp;Michelle Obama</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Joe Biden</a>, and Prince, was digging into Miranda's past when she found the story of&nbsp;David Towns and his partner Sophie, a formerly enslaved person from Virginia and the mixed-race children they had together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Davis Towns was a White man from the late 18th century. Needless to say, those were dark times for people of color. Still, he went above and beyond for the woman he loved.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a white fellow and a formerly enslaved woman and they spend their entire lives trying to outrun slavery. Every time they thought they were safe, the laws would change and they’d have to move again.</p><h2>Lin-Manuel Miranda's Ethnic Background Traced to Virginia</h2><p>Smolenyak's research indicated that Miranda's&nbsp;great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Towns, was born in the late 18th century and lost both his parents and wife at a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>Towns fought the War of 1812 against Britain as a private in the Virginia Militia.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It is unclear where, when, and how he came to meet Sophie, but the couple moved to Lousiana in 1815 because the state of Virginia would have never allowed for an interracial couple to live normal lives.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>That being said, in Lousiana, enslaved people were allowed to buy their freedom, and hence here, the couple had a chance.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They spent a decade before moving to the new country of Mexico, which, at the time, had decided to eliminate slavery and was encouraging immigration.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a harsh reality that most multiracial offspring of this era were the result of rape, an entirely lopsided power dynamic, or both. But the Townses moved from Virginia to Louisiana for better circumstances, and then to Mexico, where the entire family could finally be free.</p><p>The couple lived together till Sophie kicked the bucket in 1838. In their time together, the couple had nine children of their own.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Later Generations Were Had Mexican Ethnicity</h2><p>A census taken in 1835 revealed that the family included Juan (later John), who would become Miranda’s fourth great-grandfather.</p><p>The race columns here were left blank as preferred by the Mexican Government of the time.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Smolenyak found that Towns and Sophie’s son, Juan/John, married Mary Ann Smith, an Alabama-born daughter of African Americans.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Later generations that stemmed from this couple would take spouses who were Mexican or of Mexican ethnicity.</p><p>So, apart from the Purto Rican ethnic background that Miranda got from his father's side of the family, his ethnicity could be traced back to Mexico and even the United States, albeit the States were still in their infancy back then.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZo3qurc2unKVlnZ6%2ForrDmmSerJijtqS107JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html&text=Lin-Manuel%20Mirandas%20Ancestry%20Paints%20a%20Story%20of%20Interracial%20Love%20from%20the%20Early%2019th%20Century&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html&title=Lin-Manuel%20Mirandas%20Ancestry%20Paints%20a%20Story%20of%20Interracial%20Love%20from%20the%20Early%2019th%20Century" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html&title=Lin-Manuel%20Mirandas%20Ancestry%20Paints%20a%20Story%20of%20Interracial%20Love%20from%20the%20Early%2019th%20Century" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html&title=Lin-Manuel%20Mirandas%20Ancestry%20Paints%20a%20Story%20of%20Interracial%20Love%20from%20the%20Early%2019th%20Century" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flin-manuel-miranda-ethnicity-html.html&description=Lin-Manuel%20Mirandas%20Ancestry%20Paints%20a%20Story%20of%20Interracial%20Love%20from%20the%20Early%2019th%20Century" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./little-people-audrey-roloff-butt-swimsuit-religious-beliefs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Little People's Audrey Roloff shows off her bare butt in tiny swimsuit despite family's strict relig">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jessica-simpson-sheer-shirt-lax-photos-2015611.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Simpson Puts Her Assets Front and Center in Sheer Shirt">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
