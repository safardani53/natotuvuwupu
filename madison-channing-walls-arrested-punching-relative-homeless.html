You all are aware Harper lives with my parents currently as well as myself, up until recently. For personal reasons involving my & my family. This past month has been a complete whirlwind & I no longer have a home…&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m not going into the details, because I’m not one to bash anyone or have a pity party. But really, it ultimately has nothing to do with my end goal in this… I want nothing more than to have a home for myself & my daughter & can have a bedroom of her own.&nbsp;</p><p>“Then I can begin visitations & Harper eventually will start staying on overnights with me. My end goal is to regain custodial guardianship & my having a home is the first step towards that goal… I’m fortunate & so grateful that my best friend has opened her heart & has been letting me crash on her couch…&nbsp;</p><p>“This money would be life changing, so I won’t struggle paying at an apartment living paycheck to paycheck, & ultimately my goal would take 3 x’s as long to achieve. If this go fund me doesn’t end up working out, of course I’ll do anything to achieve that goal.</p><p>"I desperately want to be the mother Harper & I both know & want me to be, & this would help contribute to making that possible… Please consider donating or sharing this, absolutely anything helps… I love you all so much!”</p><p>Madison has a goal of $10,000, but has received no donations.&nbsp;</p><h2>CUSTODY BATTLE</h2><p>RadarOnline reported Madison <a href=#>signed over custody of her daughter</a> to her parents in 2018.</p><p>Court papers claimed her parents<strong> </strong>Cally and Michael Shapshak asked the court grant them sole custody of Harper from her and Tony, whose real name is Charles Anthony.</p><p>The petition filed in 2018 read: “Cally and Michael have had possession of the child since date of birth. The appointment of the parents as managing conservators would not be in the best interest of the child. It is in the best interest of the child that Petitioners be appointed sole managing conservators of the child.”</p><p>In Madison’s response to the petition, she wrote, “I want my parents to have custody of my daughter.”</p><p>Tony responded: “Respondent admits that Petitioners have had possession of the child. However, the mother, Madison Channing Walls, was living with petitioners at the time and it is believed that she will likely continue to do so in the future.</p><p>“Respondent also specifically denies the allegation that it is in the best interest of the child that Petitioners, the child’s grandparents, be appointed sole managing conservators of the child.”</p><p>The parties agreed to a temporary custody order.</p><p>The agreement also brought up Madison's substance abuse issues, which she has been open about.</p><p>The papers read: “Ms. Walls shall have possession and access as agreed by Ms. Walls, Mr. Shapshak and Mrs. Shapshak. However, all such periods of possession shall be supervised by Mr. or Mrs. Shapshak. Ms. Walls is currently residing on the property of Mr. and Mrs. Shapshak due to the need for support at this time.”</p><p>The papers continued that if Madison has a “relapse,” the parties “agree to recognize that Ms. Walls shall therefore no longer be permitted to reside on the property of Mr. and Mrs. Shapshak and shall immediately enter inpatient.”</p><p>The parties are prohibited from “consuming any controlled substance for which they do not have a valid prescription" and from drinking alcohol to the point of intoxication when around Harper.</p><p>The case was then sealed by the parties.</p><p>Madison's mother denied her daughter relapsed at the time, as she told RadarOnline.com: “She’s doing great. Nothing is wrong. She’s fine.”</p><p>She added of the custody filing: “The conservatorship is because it’s our family raising Harper. Tony isn’t involved. We just want to protect her. He does post about her a lot on social media, especially for someone not on the birth certificate.”</p><h2>DRUG STRUGGLE</h2><p>Madison, who dated <a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a> star Javi Marroquin briefly, has admitted to drug use on The Real World.</p><p>She said on the show: "I'm a recovering heroin addict. I am scarred for life from it. I just feel grateful to be alive."</p><p>On one episode, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>she admitted to overdosing</strong></a> on more than one occasion.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Today, Madison seems to be extremely involved in her daughter's life, as she often attends her cheerleading competitions and posts photos with her.</p><p>The last time she posted with Harper was a series of throwback photos of them together on April 14.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/sad-spiral-mtv-star-madison-813388165.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/sad-spiral-mtv-star-madison-813388295.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/sad-spiral-mtv-star-madison-813388220.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaW5%2BeoGRaKSanJmovK95wqGYp6aZo7Ruw8Clo6xlkae%2Fpr%2FTnptmqKWjsKm1zaBkq52clsGqwsRmn6illaGytL%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html&text=MTV%20star%20Madison%20Channing%20Walls%20arrested%20for%20%27punching%27%20family%20member%20before%20admitting%20she%27s%20homeles&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html&title=MTV%20star%20Madison%20Channing%20Walls%20arrested%20for%20%27punching%27%20family%20member%20before%20admitting%20she%27s%20homeles" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html&title=MTV%20star%20Madison%20Channing%20Walls%20arrested%20for%20%27punching%27%20family%20member%20before%20admitting%20she%27s%20homeles" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html&title=MTV%20star%20Madison%20Channing%20Walls%20arrested%20for%20%27punching%27%20family%20member%20before%20admitting%20she%27s%20homeles" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmadison-channing-walls-arrested-punching-relative-homeless.html&description=MTV%20star%20Madison%20Channing%20Walls%20arrested%20for%20%27punching%27%20family%20member%20before%20admitting%20she%27s%20homeles" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./p6hrmasfc5zx286lgzp8g1o-3scb-a2t.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-aniston-is-smiling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Aniston is Smiling - The Hollywood Gossip">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
