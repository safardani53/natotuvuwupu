Moreover, his wife, Helen Barclay, shares the same dream as him.</p><p>The pair have been together for a very long time, and now, they have two children to spend the rest of their lives together. The couple is fairly private about their lives and relationship history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, they share snippets of their personal life on YouTube for their fans and followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beau Miles and his wife, Helen Barclay</h2><p>It is unknown when Miles and his wife have been together. But looking at their Instagram, they seem to have been together at least since their late 20s.</p><p>Miles does not hesitate to gush about his wife whenever he gets the opportunity. Be it on his YouTube channel or his personal blog —&nbsp;Miles often reminds his fans and followers how much he loves his wife.</p><p>He did the same in April 2019 when he uploaded a <a href=# rel=noopener>video</a> titled ‘Racing my wife up a hill: Bike Rider vs Runner’ on YouTube. In the description, he gushed, “My wife, Helen, is many things: super nice, hardworking, glory parker, athlete, total hottie.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>He then wrote how he admired little quirks of hers, like creaking a lot of crumbs while eating, tripping frequently, and spilling liquids. All in all, he wrote about how he believed Barclay was a better human than him.</p><p>In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Miles built a cabin for his wife. In the description, he wrote how he decided to build a cabin/office for Barclay in the paddock without her knowing.</p><p>He did so using whatever he could find around on the property. He wrote, “What started out as a stunt to see how much secretive, ad-hoc building I could get away with, turned into the most satisfying building project I’ve ever made.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beau Miles and his children</h2><p>As said before, Miles has two children with his wife, both daughters. The pair welcomed their first daughter, May, in 2019.</p><p>In September 2020, the YouTuber shared pictures with his baby girl and wife. He wrote, “October turned to May. In a split second that took 11 hours, after 9 months of wait, I became a Dad.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Beau-Miles.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Beau Miles shares two children with his wife, Helen Barclay. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>He appreciated how his wife did a really good job while giving birth to their child. He called her a “goddess” and penned, “Helen, downright goddess, did one heck of a job, absorbing pain as I’ve never seen.”</p><p>Miles admitted that his life changed for the better after their daughter. “The little human is bounding along now (as I write, over 10 months old), ripping up a Weetbix box with squeals, double-dutch, and efficiency,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>“Life got a whole lot better when she came along, which I didn’t really think was possible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>On December 24, 2022, Miles uploaded a video titled “Why dad-daughter adventures are so damn good,” where he took May to Kayak in the snow. There he revealed his second daughter, Charlie, as well.</p><p>In another video <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">titled</a>, ‘An entire tree of firewood for our new kid,’ he talked about Charlie while making firewood for her. All in all, it seems like Miles is enjoying making videos with his children and wife and will continue to do so for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8GemK5lnZ65pr%2BMsKCfnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html&text=Beau%20Miles%20And%20Wife%20Helen%20Barclay%20Are%20Raising%20Two%20Children&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html&title=Beau%20Miles%20And%20Wife%20Helen%20Barclay%20Are%20Raising%20Two%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html&title=Beau%20Miles%20And%20Wife%20Helen%20Barclay%20Are%20Raising%20Two%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html&title=Beau%20Miles%20And%20Wife%20Helen%20Barclay%20Are%20Raising%20Two%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeau-miles-wife.html&description=Beau%20Miles%20And%20Wife%20Helen%20Barclay%20Are%20Raising%20Two%20Children" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chad-denny.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chad Denny">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anuel-aa-19921126-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anuel AA (Reggaeton Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
