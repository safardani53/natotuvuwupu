Furthermore, Brian was born in the city of Savannah, Georgia, on January 19, 1987.</p><p>Unfortunately, we could not find details regarding his parents. Added to that, the whereabouts of his siblings are also under wraps.</p><p>Talking about his education, the 36-year-old attended the University of Georgia, where he became a three-time 2nd Team All-American with their golf team.</p><p>Furthermore, he also won the 2005 NCAA Preview and the Isleworth Invitational in 2016.</p><p>And if that wasn’t enough, the Arizona native also won the three highest Grade Point Average awards. Thus, we all can agree that Brian had one hell of a college career.</p><h2>Brian Harman | Career</h2><p>Brian started his professional career back in 2009 and has been one of the better players ever since.</p><p>In fact, the 36-year-old has won four titles during his 11 years as a professional to date.</p><p>To be precise, Harman won the<strong> 2010 Manor Classic</strong>, which was also his first professional tournament win.</p><p>Then, the Arizona native won the John Deere Classic in 2014. In doing so, he won his first PGA tournament. Thereafter, Harman had to wait for another three years before winning another tour.</p><p>That moment came in 2017 when Brian won the Wells Fargo Championship to win his second PGA Tour victory.</p><p>Furthermore, during the 18th and final hole, the 36-year-old slid home a 28-foot putt to win the championship by just one stroke over <strong>Dustin Johnson</strong> and <strong>Pat Perez</strong>.</p><p>Finally, his latest tour win came in 2018 when he won the QBE Shootout.</p><p>Other than that, Brian’s memorable moments throughout his career include becoming only the third player in the PGA Tour history&nbsp;to have two aces in the same round.</p><p>Likewise, he managed the feat in 2015 at The Barclays.</p><p><strong>Brain over Dustin Know about him <a href=# rel=noopener>Dustin Johnson Bio: Early Life, Wife, Career, Education & Net worth>></a></strong></p><h2>Brian Harman | Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Brian was born in the year 1987, which makes him 36-years old currently. Likewise, the Georgia native was born on the 19th of January.</p><p>As a result, he is a Capricon when it comes to horoscope. And, about his nationality, Harman was born in Georgia, which makes him American.</p><p>Moving on, the 36-year-old stands at 1.70 m and weighs 155 lb. Furthermore, golf is a sport that does not require athletes to be in shape.</p><p>Thus, one might have forgiven brian had he not been fit. Contrarily, Harman likes to hit the gym regularly, as suggested by his magnificent physique.</p><h3>Brian Harman | World Ranking</h3><p>At the moment, Harman is ranked 136th in the <strong>Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR)</strong>, which is quite low for a player of his quality.</p><p>On the contrary, back in 2018, Brian reached his highest position in the rankings to date, the 20th position.</p><ul><li>The College University of Georgia Turned professional- 2009</li><li>Current tour(s)- PGA Tour</li><li>Professional wins- 4</li><li>Highest ranking 20- (January 14, 2018), (as of November 6,<strong> 2022</strong>).</li></ul><h2>Brian Harman | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2023, Harman has a net worth of <strong>$9 million</strong> accrued mainly from his activities as a professional golfer.</p><p>Likewise, the 36-year-old has been involved in the sport for over a decade.</p><p>Added to that, golf is probably the most lucrative sport in the market.&nbsp;Thus, his massive net worth should come as no surprise.</p><p>Regarding salaries, professional golfers do not earn a fixed salary because they don’t work or play for any organization.</p><p>Instead, they have to depend on their cash prize from each tournament.</p><p>However, golf is a rich man’s game, thus typically, total prize money for <strong>Major PGA events</strong> like the U.S Open tends to be in the tens of millions.</p><p>And while we’re on the subject of prize money, let me put it out there that Brian earned <strong>$1.3 million</strong> during the 2019-20 season.</p><p>Furthermore, over the course of his 11-year career, Harman has earned an eye-watering <strong>$16.6 million</strong> in prize money.</p><p>Likewise, this season, the 36-year-old has already won over <strong>$800,000</strong>.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Brian Harman In Different Currencies</h2><p><span>Let’s have a look at Kim Kardashian’s net worth in different currencies, including the cryptocurrency
