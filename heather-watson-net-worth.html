Saint Peter Port, Guernsey, United Kingdom, to an English father, Ian Watson, and a Papua New Guinean mother, Michelle.</p><p>Her father formerly served as the MD of Guernsey Electricity from 1995 until his retirement in 2010.</p><p>So given her father’s profession, it is safe to say that Heather, along with her three half-siblings, grew up in an affluent household.</p><img

more into swimming and won medals in butterfly, freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke events.</p><p>Heather developed an interest in tennis at a young age and started playing at seven. To advance her tennis skills, she went to the Nick Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida at 12.</p><p>As she began competing in junior competitions, her mother, Michelle, had to quit her job in 2008 and travel with her daughter around the world.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Heather did her elementary schooling in her hometown of Guernsey.</p><p>After moving to Florida at age twelve, she resumed her studies there at Pendleton High School.</p><p>Watson later attended Melrose Ladies College in Saint Peter Port in Guernsey.</p><h2>Heather Watson | Age, Height, Weight & Workout Regime</h2><p>Heather Watson is 31 years old as of 2023.
