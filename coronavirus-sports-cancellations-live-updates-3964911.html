Seasons have been suspended, tournaments have been canceled, and players have been put under quarantine, all in hope of curbing the spread of the coronavirus. As the world continues to react to this pandemic, it seems that every sporting event – from the NBA Finals to the UEFA Champions League to the 2020 Summer Olympics – is at risk of cancellation. As the sporting world continues its efforts to help in the global fight against the disease, here are the latest updates as to what’s going on in the sports world in terms of the coronavirus.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Last Updated: April 1, 2020</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>TENNIS: </strong>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the main board of the All-England Club decided to cancel Wimbledon. This marks the first time since World War II that the oldest tennis major tournament won’t go on. It’s been played since 1887, save for two periods: 1915-18 (World War I) and 1940-45 (World War II.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Initially, it was scheduled for June 29 to July 12, but no more. “This is a decision that we have not taken lightly, and we have done so with the highest regard for public health and the well-being of all those who come together to make Wimbledon happen,” <strong>Ian Hewitt</strong>, the All-England Club Chairman, said in the April 1 statement, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>. “It has weighed heavily on our minds that the staging of The Championships has only been interrupted previously by World Wars but, following thorough and extensive consideration of all scenarios, we believe that it is a measure of this global crisis that it is ultimately the right decision to cancel this year’s Championships, and instead concentrate on how we can use the breadth of Wimbledon’s resources to help those in our local communities and beyond. Our thoughts are with all those who have been and continue to be affected by these unprecedented times.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>THE KENTUCKY DERBY</strong>: “Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI) announced its decision to reschedule the 146th Longines Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve,” the organization announced in a Mar. 17 press release. “The 146th Kentucky Derby will be rescheduled from May 2, 2020, to September 5, 2020, and the 146th Kentucky Oaks will be rescheduled from May 1, 2020, to September 4, 2020. These dates are contingent upon final approval from the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission which is expected Thursday, March 19.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Throughout the rapid development of the COVID-19 pandemic, our first priority has been how to best protect the safety and health of our guests, team members and community,” said CDI’s CEO, <strong>Bill Carstanjen</strong>. “As the situation evolved, we reached the difficult conclusion that we needed to reschedule. At no point did we ever consider canceling the Kentucky Derby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>It wasn’t made clear that the two other races in the Triple Crown — the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes — were rescheduled, but after seeing the Kentucky Derby postponed, it’s probably only a matter of time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>THE BOSTON MARATHON</strong>: The 124th running of the Boston Marathon has been postponed. Originally scheduled for April 20, it has now been pushed back to Sept. 14, according to the Boston Athletic Association, per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Washington Post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>GOLF</strong>: The Masters has been postponed. “Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals,” Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said in a statement Friday morning, per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>.&nbsp;“Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision. We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>BASKETBALL</strong>:&nbsp;The NBA announced on Mar. 11 that it would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suspend the rest of its 2019-2020 season</a> after Utah Jazz player <strong>Rudy Gobert</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tested positive</a> for COVID-19. “The N.B.A. will use this hiatus to determine the next steps for moving forward regarding the coronavirus pandemic,” the league said in a statement, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. A day after the announcement, Jazz player <strong>Donovan Mitchell</strong> also tested positive for COVID-19. The NBA G-League also suspended its season indefinitely as they figure out the next step. More NBA players who’ve tested positive for coronavirus include: <strong>Christian Wood</strong> (Detroit Pistons), and four Brooklyn Nets players, who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the team</a> has not yet identified.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The NCAA said that its men’s and women’s basketball tournament (aka “March Madness”) would continue by being held in empty arenas, with only essential staff and limited family members would be allowed to watch the game in person.

Repeat:&nbsp;<strong>March Madness has been canceled.</strong> “Today, NCAA President Mark Emmert and the Board of Governors canceled the Division I men’s and women’s 2020 basketball tournaments, as well as all remaining winter and spring NCAA championships.
