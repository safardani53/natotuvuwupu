He just held me and said he loved me, and I know he’s so happy for me. And, um, thank you for that.”</p><p>It certainly got all the attention for the 2000 awards ceremony, but the actress and family insisted it was just a display of sibling love - not incest.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair have always been close and in 2014 a family friend explained the pair had spent the day at the hospital with their mum for her first cancer treatment, before getting ready and heading to the bash.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever it was, it certainly made the then relatively unknown Angelina a star of the show and the main topic of conversation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=streaker-storms-stage>Streaker storms stage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/JW-OSCAR-STREAKER-MUZZED.jpg><p>It’s rare for a superstar to be upstaged, especially at the biggest awards event of the year, but in 1974 a random streaker managed it.&nbsp;</p><p>English teacher Robert Opel hit the headlines after stripping off and running on stage behind host David Niven at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</p><p>The streaker, who was a gay rights activist, claimed it was a piece of performance art and a social comment on issues at the time.</p><p>Opel wasn’t arrested and was instead ushered backstage to explain to the waiting journalists why he had chosen to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>He also stripped at other events in Los Angeles and owned an art gallery wich featured homoerotic art.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=envelope-gate-sees-la-la-land-accidentally-crowned-winner>Envelope-gate sees La La Land accidentally crowned winner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/fd3231bc-e55c-406d-94fa-8ab02c71a4f9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000305289611.jpg><p>The winners of the night are kept a closely guarded secret until they are announced on stage and normally it goes without a hitch - apart from in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>A shocking blunder saw La La Land announced as the winner of the night’s biggest award, Best Picture, instead of the actual winner Moonlight.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t until the acceptance speeches were in full flow that an official rushed on to the stage to correct the mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>La La Land producer Fred Berger said: "We lost by the way, but you know."</p><p>Fellow producer Jordan Horowitz then said: "Guys, I'm sorry, no, there's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won best picture."</p><p>And the third producer Marc Platt said: "This is not a joke I'm afraid, they read the wrong thing."&nbsp;</p><p>Award presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty looked baffled when they opened the envelope and it later transpired that they had been handed the one for Best Actress by accident.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking about the incident, Beatty explained: "I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope, and it said Emma Stone, La La Land. That's why I took such a long look at Faye, and at you [the audience], I wasn't trying to be funny."</p><h2 id=edy-williams-very-revealing-showgirl-outfit>Edy Williams' VERY revealing showgirl

glamorous person there - a chance Twilight Zone extra Edy Williams grabbed.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress, 79, opted to dress in a risque showgirl outfit made purely of pearls that barely covered her modesty for the 1986 ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>Just four years before she had turned up in a fur coat and leopard print bikini and walked her Great Dane down the red carpet.&nbsp;</p><p>She certainly
