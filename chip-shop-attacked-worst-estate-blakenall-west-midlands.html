I felt sickened and scared and it was very disturbing.”</p><p>The 44-year-old added: "We’re too scared to walk home from work alone for fear of being abused."</p><p>Another resident, a cleaner, 46, added: "It used to be a decent place to live but now it’s awful and I’m not surprised it’s been called the worst place in the country."</p><p>While one local claimed: "The yobs even smashed up the local primary school yesterday and ran off when police arrived."</p><p>It used to be a decent place to live but now it’s awful and I’m not surprised it’s been called the worst place in the country</p><span class=quote-credit>Resident</span><p>West Midlands Police say they are stepping up patrols and using dispersal orders to try and control the issues.</p><p>Inspector Phil Upton of Walsall Neighbourhood Team, said: "We are aware of growing concern around instances of appalling behaviour by a small minority of young people in the Blakenall area.</p><p>"We understand how upsetting and worrying this can be and we have been carrying out extra patrols in the area to discourage further incidents and help with our on-going enquiries.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"'Our work to tackle this issue is continuing and evolving, with further increased patrols planned along with targeted action to curb this totally unacceptable behaviour."</p><p>A Walsall Council spokesperson said:&nbsp;“The&nbsp;council is actively working in partnership with West Midlands Police colleagues, partners and the local community to tackle these issues.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ6fZhtaW9nk522sXnSoaapZZGpwaKvyp6bZq%2Bfp8C1ecSsq5qslWKvra3KnqWapJxixKa%2F02akopyclrulv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html&text=I%20run%20chippy%20on%20%27UK%27s%20worst%20estate%27%20-%20vile%20yobs%20throw%20dead%20PIGEONS%20in%20my%20shop&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html&title=I%20run%20chippy%20on%20%27UK%27s%20worst%20estate%27%20-%20vile%20yobs%20throw%20dead%20PIGEONS%20in%20my%20shop" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html&title=I%20run%20chippy%20on%20%27UK%27s%20worst%20estate%27%20-%20vile%20yobs%20throw%20dead%20PIGEONS%20in%20my%20shop" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html&title=I%20run%20chippy%20on%20%27UK%27s%20worst%20estate%27%20-%20vile%20yobs%20throw%20dead%20PIGEONS%20in%20my%20shop" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchip-shop-attacked-worst-estate-blakenall-west-midlands.html&description=I%20run%20chippy%20on%20%27UK%27s%20worst%20estate%27%20-%20vile%20yobs%20throw%20dead%20PIGEONS%20in%20my%20shop" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./luke-and-kate-married-at-first-sight-still-together.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is 'Married at First Sight' Couple Luke and Kate Still Together?
