I don’t have to put on a front to impress anyone.”</p><p>But the same week, the pair were banned from Spirit Airlines after Danielle punched a passenger who accused Barbara of taking too long to store her luggage.</p><p>The same month Danielle was involved in a brawl outside a bar and, in March 2017, police were called to the home she shares with Barbara and a video emerged which appeared to show the pair fighting.</p><p>Danielle later dismissed the incident as "fun and games."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000299975539.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000311308182-1-e1578397501395.jpg><h2>Unlikely rap star at 13</h2><p>While some were trying to cash in on Danielle's phrase, others saw she had money-making potential in her own right.</p><p>At the height of her viral infamy, music managers Adam Kluger and Dan Roof signed her up as an artist – despite zero musical experience.</p><p>In February 2017 she starred in Kodak Black’s Everything 1K video, sitting on a Rolls Royce and waving wads of cash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552159107.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NINTCHDBPICT000552159109.jpg><p>And just seven months after her first Dr Phil, her debut single These Heaux – released under the name Bhad Bhabie - became a massive hit, making her the youngest ever rapper to enter the Billboard 100 and clocking up over 80 million YouTube views.</p><p>Atlantic Records snapped her up and Kluger admits her rebellious behaviour helped.</p><p>“The only calculated thing in those seven months was our strategy to keep her actively in headlines,” he told Entrepreneur.com. “Most of that was her doing, whether good or bad.
