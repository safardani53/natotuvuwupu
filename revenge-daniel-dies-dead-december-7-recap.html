And he met his demise in the most heroic way possible — in the arms of Emily, shortly after trying to save her life from Agent Kate Taylor.</p><h3>‘Revenge’: 5 Reasons Why [SPOILER] Shouldn’t Have&nbsp;Died</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>We knew Emily and Daniel’s emotional talks with each other, over the course of the last few weeks, were too good to be true. Now we’ll never get the reunion we were hoping for. Sigh.</p><h3><a href=#>‘Revenge’: Josh Bowman Wanted Daniel Grayson To Be Killed&nbsp;Off</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Now that we’ve vented, let’s rewind a bit and take a look at what happened this week.</p><h3>Reunited & It Feels So Good</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nolan’s persistence led him back into the good graces of Louise. After a number failed attempts with phone calls, texting and emails, Nolan finally mustered up the courage to confront Louise, face-to-face, and apologize for scheming against her with Margaux. Apparently, he’s become quite fond of the Hamptons’ southern belle and regretted ever siding with Margaux, who hates Louise for sleeping with Daniel. He even invited her to co-host the grand opening of his new club. But something tells us Louise has a plan to get back at Nolan up her sleeve.</p><h3>David Attempts To Poison Victoria</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>We have no idea why David and Victoria are even together because not only did Mrs. Grayson put a hit out on Emily (which ultimately killed her son), but David slipped some sort of pill in Victoria’s glass of wine! (Side note: He was definitely trying to kill her because he said it in the preview for the Jan. 4 episode.) Anyway, Victoria didn’t manage to drink the polluted wine because she was too busy telling David that she was the one who handed his computer over&nbsp;to Conrad, helping frame him for the bombing of flight 197. She said she did this because she found out David was lying about Emily’s — Amanda, at the time — mother. He said she had died, when she was really in a mental institution. When Victoria realized she couldn’t trust David, she clung to Conrad. But she said she has regretted that decision ever since.</p><h3>Daniel Makes Amends</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>We hate to say it, but we had a feeling Daniel was going to be the one to meet his maker tonight, when the entire episode revolved around him making amends with the people in his life. First, he set Margaux up with the best OBGYN in NYC. Then, he experienced reflections of conversations with his dad, Conrad, regarding that grisly car accident that occurred before the series began. He also had a cordial conversation with Victoria, which says a lot, and of course, he’s been getting along with Emily as of late. Everything was starting to go well for Daniel — a little too well. After all, he also has a baby on the way. Unfortunately, he’ll never meet that baby. As he was sitting on the beach, reminiscing about his life, Margaux called him and told him to head back to the hotel. She wanted to give him another chance. Unfortunately, he heard loud bangs and glass breaking at Emily’s house, so he did what any hero would do (yes, we just called Daniel a hero) — he ran towards the danger.</p><h3>Emily & Agent Kate Taylor Face Off</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>The loud bangs were, indeed, coming from Emily’s house. While at a party, Agent Kate Taylor, who’s been dating Jack, confronted Emily and admitted she knew her true identity. But instead of outing her, Kate said she wanted to team up with Emily and take down Malcolm Black, who’s after David. So, of course, Kate arrived at Emily’s house (later that night?) for a chit chat. After Kate revealed her plan to take Malcolm down, Emily called the FBI agent’s&nbsp;bluff and accused her of coming there to kill her. And she was right! Kate, who admitted she’s Malcolm’s daughter, pulled a gun out and tried shooting Emily. Luckily, Emily already removed the bullets, but then they just used their hands and feet and beat the crap out of each other. This is where Daniel heard the racket and ran towards the old Grayson Manor. Upon seeing Emily pulling herself across the floor by her elbows, Daniel ran into the house to try and save her. In that short amount of time, though, Kate grabbed her bullets, loaded her gun and aimed. Emily yelled for Daniel to run and save his own life, but he blocked her and got shot in the process — twice. (Ugh. We hate even writing this.) Jack then ran in and killed Kate by shooting her multiple times. Unfortunately, it was too late for Daniel. He died in Emily’s arms as she told him that their relationship “wasn’t all a lie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It seems like everyone Emily loves dies in misery. First Ayden, then Daniel. Is Jack next?! We hope not.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Are you shocked that Daniel&nbsp;died?! Tell us how you feel!</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>— Chris Rogers</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @ChrisRogers86</a></p><h3>More ‘Revenge’&nbsp;News:</h3><li>‘Revenge’ Recap: [SPOILER] Reveals She’s Pregnant</li><li>‘Revenge’: Emily Thorne Goes On Romantic Date With [SPOILER]</li><li>‘Revenge’ Recap: New Enemies Threaten Emily & David’s Reunion</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH5ze49wZqudppq7qLGMnZinoZWheqW1xKxknZ2RmXqlscKepJudomKEbr7EnJipZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html&text=Daniel%20Dies%20Trying%20To%20Save%20Emily%20%20December%207%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html&title=Daniel%20Dies%20Trying%20To%20Save%20Emily%20%20December%207%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html&title=Daniel%20Dies%20Trying%20To%20Save%20Emily%20%20December%207%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html&title=Daniel%20Dies%20Trying%20To%20Save%20Emily%20%20December%207%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frevenge-daniel-dies-dead-december-7-recap.html&description=Daniel%20Dies%20Trying%20To%20Save%20Emily%20%20December%207%20Recap%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./catriona-gray.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Catriona Gray net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./crispian-mills.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Crispian Mills">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
