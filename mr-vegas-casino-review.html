Megaways, branded, jackpot and classic slots are found, coming with varying themes, pay lines and bonus rounds. Standout slots include Starburst, Rise of Olympus, Bonanza, Book of Dead, Legacy of Dead and Mega Joker. The vast majority of slots are available to play on smartphones and tablets.

The minimum withdrawal amount is £10. Unfortunately, a £2.50 processing fee is incurred with all withdrawals, with the maximum amount being £3,000 per week or £6,000 per month.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Payout rates</h3><p>Payouts at Mr Vegas are generally processed within 72 hours. This can be quicker, with those using PayPal, <a href=#>Skrill</a> and <a href=#>Neteller</a> having to wait just a few hours in most cases.
