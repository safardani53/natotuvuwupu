First and foremost, his mother, Alexandra, or Alex, is a model and a fashion columnist for the Daily Mirror.</p><p>In 2007, she also released her fragrance, “Alex,” which quickly became a best seller. Alex began her career as a nail technician before moving on to modeling. She is also a writer who has contributed to publications such as OK! Magazine and the Daily Mirror. She is a businesswoman who started her own perfume and clothesline.</p><p>His father, Steven, is a professional football player and manager who was once regarded as one of the world’s most complete players in the early 2000s. Steven had also won the award for Young Player of the Year in England. He’s also been named Player of the Year by the Professional Footballers’ Association at the end of seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/komh-1.webp><h2>All to know about Lio Gerrard siblings</h2><p>Lio isn’t his famous parents’ only child. He does, however, have three siblings. Lilly-Ella Gerrard, who is currently 18 years old, is the oldest. Lexie Gerrard, who is now 16 years old, is the second born after her.</p><p>Lio is the youngest of the three, having been born in 2011. Lourdes Gerrard is 10 years old. Lilly-Ella, his eldest sister, has 151,000 Instagram followers. Her biography also states that she is based in Liverpool.</p><p>Sasha Attwood, Jack Grealish’s partner, and Brooke Vincent, a Coronation Street actress, had been following her. Ella has been living the high life, and we frequently see her wearing luxury dresses and carrying Prada handbags, Louis Vuitton suitcases, and other high-end accessories.</p><h2>How long did Steven date Alex before marrying her?</h2><p>In the year 2002, Steven and Alex began dating. He proposed to Alex after several years of being in a love relationship.</p><p>The two people exchanged vows in a magnificent wedding ceremony on June 16, 2007. Cliveden House, a luxurious hotel in Buckinghamshire, hosted their celebration. Alex is two years younger than her husband, according to reports.</p><p>They seem to be having a wonderful time with their family, as evidenced by the lady’s Instagram account, @ Alex Gerrard, where she posts gorgeous images of their children.</p><h2>Switched Boyfriend</h2><p>Steven dated Jennifer Ellison in the past, while his present wife Alex was seeing Tony Richardson, a businessman. Jennifer and Alex, however, are said to have switched boyfriends around the year 2002. Perhaps, as the Guardian remarked, the topic of who stole who remains a mystery.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2Bmecuipmaflae%2For7DZqeaqpWjwbR5wKebZq%2BYmr%2BmecOim2asmJrGbq%2FOppxmnqKkunA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html&text=Who%20Are%20Lio%20Gerrard%20Parents%20And%20Where%20Did%20They%20Come%20From%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html&title=Who%20Are%20Lio%20Gerrard%20Parents%20And%20Where%20Did%20They%20Come%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html&title=Who%20Are%20Lio%20Gerrard%20Parents%20And%20Where%20Did%20They%20Come%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html&title=Who%20Are%20Lio%20Gerrard%20Parents%20And%20Where%20Did%20They%20Come%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-lio-gerrard-parents-and-where-did-they-come-from.html&description=Who%20Are%20Lio%20Gerrard%20Parents%20And%20Where%20Did%20They%20Come%20From%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./andrew-jay-datu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew Jay Datu- Bio, Age, Height, Net worth, Girlfriend, Dating">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tobias-dorzon-19841123-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tobias Dorzon (Chef) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
