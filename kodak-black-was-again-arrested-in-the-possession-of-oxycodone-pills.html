On July 15, he was driving a Dodge Durango in Ft. Lauderdale, according to law enforcement officials.&nbsp;When the officers smelt marijuana, they pulled him over and searched his vehicle. The cops allegedly discovered 31 oxycodone pills and $74,690 in cash. According to a few reports, the rapper’s license and tags have also expired. According to the most recent report, Black’s lawyer told a news outlet:</p><p>“Never base a decision on an arrest.” There are facts and circumstances that support a defense, particularly in this situation. We secured a $75,000 bail and want to resolve the issue as soon as possible.”</p><p>Black has been charged with illegally having a controlled narcotic and trafficking in oxycodone.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>SLATER SCOOP: Kodak Black was arrested on Friday in South Florida.</p><p>Cops pulled over the rapper and during a search found 30+ Oxycodone pills and over $50,000 in cash, multiple sources tell me.</p><p>— Andy Slater (@AndySlater) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2022</a></p><h2>Detail about the oxycodone tablets discovered in Kodak Black’s vehicle</h2><p>When other pain medications do not work or are not tolerated, oxycodone tablets are used to treat severe pain that needs opioid therapy. The medicines reduce pain by acting on the central nervous system.&nbsp;The tablets should not be taken if a person need pain medication for a short length of time, such as after surgery. It should be avoided for modest pain relief or in instances where non-narcotic medications are effective. It should not be used to treat single-occurrence pain.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kodak-Black-1.jpg alt="Kodak Black" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When taken over an extended period of time, oxycodone may induce mental or physical dependency. Meanwhile, persons suffering from chronic pain should not be discouraged from utilizing legally prescribed drugs to relieve their symptoms.&nbsp;If opioids are used for this reason, mental dependency may not emerge, and physical dependence may result in withdrawal symptoms if therapy is abruptly discontinued. Severe withdrawal symptoms may be avoided by temporarily lowering the dosage before discontinuing medication.</p><h2>The legal history of Kodak Black</h2><p>Despite his celebrity as a rapper, Kodak Black has had several legal difficulties throughout his life. In 2015, he was arrested on allegations of violence, robbery, wrongful confinement of a minor, and cannabis possession.&nbsp;The next year, Black was caught and charged with having a firearm by a convicted felon, marijuana possession, and running from authorities. In 2016, he was arrested again on allegations of armed robbery and false imprisonment. He was sentenced to five years probation, community service, and anger management training, as well as being put on house arrest for a year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Kodak-Black-3.jpg alt="Kodak Black" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In February 2017, he was jailed for breaking his probation, and his musical tour was canceled. He was sentenced to 364 days in the Broward County Jail and was placed on house arrest for a year with five years of probation upon his release In May 2017.</p><p>In January 2018, Kodak Black was arrested again on suspicion of providing drugs and a pistol to a little kid in an Instagram video.
