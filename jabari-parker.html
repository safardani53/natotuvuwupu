However, his family is Christian, and they all are members of the LDS Church.</p><p>Brought up in Chicago, Parker initially attended Robert A. Black Magnet Elementary School. He learned to play basketball very early, and his older brothers, mainly Christian, were his first playmates.</p><p>Moreover, his father, Sonny, was a retired veteran NBA player, and he was pretty happy that his sons followed in his footsteps.

As a result, Jabari became a basketball prodigy and began playing in middle school leagues.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, his cousin, Jay, was very close to him and was his primary motivator during his school years. His other siblings supported their younger brother by making a presence regularly during his games.</p><p>His other brother, Darryl, also played basketball and later appeared for the Oregon Ducks. Similarly, Christian played college basketball for Brigham Young University-Hawaii.</p><p>However, Jabari was the only one among the Parker brothers to reach the farthest in his endeavors.</p><p>He was destined to get that success from the start because he was always the best in the game.</p><p>Parker was so good that he began receiving scholarship offers from colleges when he was just a fifth-grader. He later transferred to Simeon Academy and graduated high school in 2013 before attending Duke University for further studies.</p><h2>Jabari Parker | Age, Weight & Height</h2><p>As of <span>2023, Jabari Parker is 28 years old.</span></p><p>And Parker stands at 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 meters) tall and weighs around 111 kg (245 pounds).</p><h2>Jabari Parker | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Jabari Parker’s four-year career at the Simeon Career Academy must be one of his best times.
