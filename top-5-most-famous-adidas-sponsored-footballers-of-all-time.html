Adidas’ stature in the world of sports has only grown since its inception in 1924, making it one of the largest suppliers of sports equipment and always been present in football history. They have produced and designed memorable kits, balls, and boots for footballers and teams competing in major tournaments. Adidas continues to face stiff competition in the football industry from Nike and Puma.</p><p>Some of the greatest footballers have graced the field while being sponsored by Adidas over the years. Paul Pogba, Toni Kroos, Leo Messi, and Mo Salah are some of the most well-known Adidas users right now.</p><h2>Number 5: Michel Platini</h2><p>Michel Platini is one of the all-time greats, having won three Ballon d’Or awards. The French legend won numerous titles and personal accolades at Nancy, Saint-Etienne, and Juventus. Between 1983 and 1985, Platini won the Ballon d’Or three years in a row, demonstrating unprecedented dominance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Michel-Platini-.jpg><p>Platini was ruthless in front of goal, as evidenced by France’s victory in the 1984 Euros. He was the tournament’s top scorer and best player, and he went on to have a sensational season with Juventus. Throughout his illustrious career, the Frenchman was a fan of and frequent wearer of Adidas boots.</p><p>Platini was another great who spent the majority of his career wearing Adidas kits and boots.</p><h2>Number 4: Franz Beckenbauer</h2><p>In 1972, Franz Beckenbauer became the first defender to win the Ballon d’Or, and he repeated the feat four years later. The German legend was more than just a defender; he was a libero who set new standards in football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Franz-Beckenbauer-2.jpg><p>Beckenbauer was an undisputed Bayern Munich great, appearing over 500 times for the Bavarians during his illustrious career. He led his country to victory in the 1972 Euros and the FIFA World Cup just two years later.</p><p>Beckenbauer not only endorsed Adidas boots but also other products such as tracksuits, which became well-known over time.</p><h2>Number 3: Gerd Muller</h2><p>Adidas, as a German corporation, has long been associated with the German national team. Adidas’ most prominent endorser was Gerd Muller, who was honored with Der Bomber customized kits and boots. Muller was the first German to be named Ballon d’Or winner. He also won the FIFA World Cup and the European Cup, as well as the most coveted individual award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gerd-Muller.jpg><p>It would be an understatement to call Muller’s goal-scoring exploits legendary. During his illustrious career, he scored over 500 goals for Bayern Munich, assisting the club to four Bundesliga titles and three European Cups. Muller is one of Germany’s all-time leading scorers, with 68 goals, including ten in the 1970 World Cup.</p><p>Muller’s extraterrestrial exploits have solidified his legacy as one of the greatest goal scorers of all time.</p><h2>Number 2: Zinedine Zidane</h2><p>With his majestic presence on the pitch, Zinedine Zidane personified grace, flair, and dominance over the years. The French legend has had it all and has demonstrated his exceptional qualities throughout his career. He played for Juventus, Real Madrid, and, most importantly, the French national team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Zinedine-Zidane-4.jpg><p>Zidane’s talent knew no bounds, from superb ball control to extraterrestrial vision. He could do anything on the field, making opposing defenders’ lives a living nightmare. Zidane, one of the most technically gifted footballers of all time, was always able to make headlines on the biggest stages.</p><p>Zidane’s brace against Brazil in 1998 helped France win the World Cup, demonstrating his importance to his team. ‘Zizou’ joined Los Blancos in 2001 after a successful spell with Juventus. With his venomous volley in the final, he gifted them a UEFA Champions League trophy, which Madridistas still cherish.</p><p>Later, Zidane returned to Real Madrid as manager, leading the club to three consecutive Champions League titles. Throughout his career, he has been a significant cash cow for Adidas. Even though he retired more than a decade ago, Zidane has appeared in Adidas ad campaigns.</p><h2>Number 1: Lionel Messi</h2><p>Lionel Messi, who is on his way to winning his seventh Ballon d’Or, is widely regarded as the greatest player ever to play the game. Messi has broken and set many records since his debut for Barcelona, with countless individual awards, trophies, and accolades following him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Lionel-Messi-1-1.jpg><p>Messi has rewritten history for both Barcelona and Argentina over the last two decades. His heroics helped Argentina win the Copa America title in 2021, his first major triumph with his country.</p><p>Messi’s greatness for Barcelona is unrivaled. Before joining PSG this summer, he had 672 goals and 301 careers.</p><p>Messi has been the face of Adidas since 2006. He recently signed a lifetime contract with Adidas, and the Argentine will be honored with personalized soccer cleats. Messi is currently wearing Adidas x Speedflow shoes, which are designed for his speed.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanquu9KtZJ%2BZnaTCtHnAnaCdmaNiwLG7zaymq52UYrOwu9ObmKWklafAbrvFZpilpF2ptq6xjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html&text=Top%205%20Most%20Famous%20Adidas-Sponsored%20Footballers%20Of%20All%20Time&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html&title=Top%205%20Most%20Famous%20Adidas-Sponsored%20Footballers%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html&title=Top%205%20Most%20Famous%20Adidas-Sponsored%20Footballers%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html&title=Top%205%20Most%20Famous%20Adidas-Sponsored%20Footballers%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-5-most-famous-adidas-sponsored-footballers-of-all-time.html&description=Top%205%20Most%20Famous%20Adidas-Sponsored%20Footballers%20Of%20All%20Time" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-elizabeth-chambers-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Elizabeth Chambers Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./escape-room-3-zoey-ben-logan-miller-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Logan Miller Reveals What He Wants To Happen  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
