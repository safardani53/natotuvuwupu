Lottie, who is currently single, previously dated former Made In Chelsea cast member <a href=#>Sam Prince</a> and British actor&nbsp;<a href=#>Christian Cooke</a>.</p><p>The model opened up about getting a boob job last year, but admitted she regretted getting lip injections after following the crowd.</p><p>Lottie said: “I did my boobs and I’m very happy with that. You’ve got to spend some money on your-self and you’ve got to treat yourself, and this is one of those little treats that women like to do.”</p><p>Speaking on social media last week, Lottie also claimed that she had been working on herself during the weeks of lockdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000314247867.jpg><p>She added: “It’s been really nice, actually.</p><p>“I’ve spent time by myself and healing and working on myself, which has been amazing.</p><p>“I’ve been reading lots of self-help books and taking care of my skin a lot more. I’ve run every day.</p><p>“It’s really just a time to try and focus on yourself and better yourself, so that when you come out of this isolation you feel amazing, refreshed and rebooted.”</p><p>A little too refreshed, some might say.<br></p><h2>Zara has room to spare</h2><p>IT didn’t take long for <a href=#>Zara McDermott</a> to take over boyfriend <a href=#>Sam Thompson</a>’s spare room after moving in with him for lockdown.</p><p>The ex-Love Island star, currently fronting online retailer boohoo’s #boohoointhehouse social media campaign, needed somewhere to put all her clothes after nesting in the Made In Chelsea regular’s home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000584611378.jpg><p>It comes after she also sang on The X Factor: Celebrity and joined Sam for some tiffs with the toffs on E4’s MIC.</p><p>She said: “I convinced Sam to flatpack his bed and we’ve turned his second bedroom into a massive walk-in wardrobe. It’s great to be able to spread out and put a dressing table in there.</p><p>“I’ve also created a studio in his basement where I can record songs. He has been very accommodating.”</p><p>Let’s hope Sam sees it that way.<br></p><h2>It's nifty Nigella</h2><p>NIGELLA Lawson might be worth an estimated £16 million – but it doesn’t stop her being frugal.</p><p>The TV cook refuses to waste a morsel and has a wealth of thrifty kitchen hacks, from freezing bits of cheese to serving up spud peelings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000534092228.jpg><p>She said: “I freeze leftover milk, and cheese, including the Parmesan ends and rinds. I also freeze peelings of vegetables to make stock or soup. I make my potato-peeling crisps.”</p><p>On The Bunker podcast, she added: “I used gone-off milk to make bread the other day.” There’s a canny cookbook idea here.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">CAUGHT OUT</h3></p><p><a data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/megan-mckenna/ href=#>Megan McKenna</a> support slots for Lionel Richie in Wrexham and Cardiff move to June 3 and Aug 1, 2021</p><p>JLS’ <a data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/marvin-humes/ href=#>Marvin Humes</a> is cashing in on his dapper looks by fronting a campaign for Next.
