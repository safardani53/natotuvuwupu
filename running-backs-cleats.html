Running backs, receivers, defensive backs, linebackers, quarterbacks, tight ends, and lineman wears different style cleats to support their foot movement as per position demand.</p><p>Football cleats along can make a huge difference in your performance. And this can be the reason why big brands like Nike and Adidas design cleats for a player playing in a different position.</p><p>While reading this article, you will come across the best running backs cleats from Nike and Adidas.</p><p>Before jumping into the best cleats, let’s clarify some misperceptions and get knowledge about football shoes.</p><h2>Cleats Hurt???</h2><p>Nope, cleats don’t hurt.</p><p>Clears may hurt only when if you get the wrong fit. Usually, clears are slit. If you get cleats of the same size as your normal shoes, then your feet may pain.</p><p>Wrong size cleats won’t support your ankle, front foot, knee, and arch causing foot pain.</p><p>Too tight cleats can cause stress to the heel, which hampers your performance. So, be careful when you get football cleats.</p><p>When you get cleat, you need to get one size up or at least half size up than your normal shoe size.</p><p>As cleats are manufactured narrow to give snug feet, if you are wide footed, you will definitely need one or one and a half size up, depending upon the brand and model.</p><p>However, if you are new to football, you may not feel comfortable because they are designed for a tight fit.</p><p>Once you get the right size and start wearing them regularly, you will surely feel comfortable while running on the field.</p><p>For the running backs position, you will need light-weight cleats to help you run after the ball. Sliding your feet in the right size football cleats enables you to perform as you desire.</p><p>All you need to know is the size of the right cleats.</p><h2>Are Cleats Supportive??</h2><p>Of course, they are.</p><p>Having a soft cushion-like comfort underneath your feet is exactly what you need when you play all day.</p><p>If you are a football player, you don’t need an explanation on cleats, but if you are new to football, you may not know what cleats actually do.</p><p>So, for those who don’t know, here are reason what cleats do to comfort you throughout the game.</p><p>Consider buying football shoes only after analyzing the upper, outsole, cleat, midsole, and heel. These features together provide comfort and support to your feet.</p><h3>Upper</h3><p>Upper is the part under the lace design to secure your feet. Some cleats have straps and laces, and some have only laces to provide the perfect fit.</p><p>People may think cleats with both strap and lace gives more comfort than cleats with only laces. But it doesn’t work like that.</p><p>Cleats with only lace can equally comfort you and secure your feet. It depends on which type of football shoe you prefer.</p><p>The upper of the cleats is constructed with synthetic material to minimize impacts and rough weather conditions.</p><h3>Midsole</h3><p>The midsole is supposed to act as a bed for your feet. When you play on the field, you don’t want a hard insole under your feet. Rather having a soft and little bouncy insole supports your performance.</p><p>This part of the cleats is designed in a way to provide both support and impact absorption. Base on the foam used, the midsole can provide support and comfort.</p><p>The flexibility of cleats is also defined by the type of midsole used to manufacture cleats. Soft and bouncy midsole ensures your comfort and flexibility.</p><h3>Outsole</h3><p>What matters most when playing football is your foot stability. And your foot stability depends upon the football cleats you are wearing.</p><p>Usually, the outsole is constructed using plastic and rubber to provide stability at the perfect time you need while running for the ball. The outsole is also responsible for providing the flexibility you need on the field.</p><h3>Studs</h3><p>Studs are placed at the bottom of the football shoe. They are the most important part of cleats that improves traction. Studs ensure foot safety and comfort on the ground.</p><p>Placement of studs affects acceleration, stopping, and cutting. They are placed strategically to support your performance, providing you great control and grip.</p><h3>Heel</h3><p>Typically, the heel of the cleat is designed in a way to protect your heel from collapsing. The heel of the cleat must provide just the right support to absorb impact.</p><p>A cleat is designed with enough padding to help you go after the ball without hurting your feet.</p><h2>Which Cleat Comforts Running backs?</h2><p>Low-cut cleats are perfect for running backs. However, mid-cut cleats and low-cut cleats are used for running back, but low-cut cleats are recommended.</p><p>Low-cut cleats allow running backs to showcase their skills on the ground. They are light in weight which gives you maximum foot control.&nbsp;</p><p>Not just for running backs, low-cuts cleats are suitable for receivers and defensive backs as well. So, if you are defensive backs or receivers, you may choose to buy branded cleats from the mentioned list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GOLETTO-vii-Fg-300x213.jpg><p>These cleats from Adidas are super light, enabling you to run the ball on the ground.
