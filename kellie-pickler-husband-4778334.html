According to Wikipedia, Kyle was born June 26, 1973 and grew up in Bloomington, Minn. Like his famous wife, he was a multi-talented musician who sang, wrote songs, and played piano and guitar.&nbsp;Kellie was born on June 28, 1986, which made her hubby a full 13 years her senior.</p><h2>The Couple Met Through Friends In 2007</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kyle and Kellie met at a bar in 2007 through mutual friends from Nashville. Kellie explained that she was there with some songwriter pals when she met Kyle during a Nov. 2015 interview on the Fox daytime talk show, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real</a>. “So we ended up sitting with him and his buddies, and we got lost in conversation and everybody else disappeared,” she gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Even better, they started working together right away, and they clicked creatively as well as romantically. “We started writing songs the next day, and then we got hitched, well, that happened a few years later,” she added.</p><h2>Kyle & Kellie Eloped For A New Year’s Day Wedding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kellie-Pickler-Husband-5-Things-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The country music couple got engaged on June 15, 2010 in Rosemary Beach, Fla., and it was supremely romantic! While on vacation, Kyle gave Kellie a journal, an engagement ring, and a seashell with “Faye” (the name of Kellie’s late grandmother) inscribed on it. “It was like my beautiful angel, the one I call Mom, was giving us her blessing,” Kellie later wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2017 Instagram post.</a> “Still and forever crazy in love.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The couple wound up eloping in Antigua on Jan. 1, 2011, forgoing their original plan of a massive wedding celebration in Nashville. “All we did was I packed the wedding dress and packed him an outfit,” Kellie told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres </strong></a>during a 2011 appearance, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “We totally just put faith in God that it was all going to work out, and it did, and it was the most incredible day of my life.”</p><h2>They Never Had Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Kellie and her hubby never had children together, but they were devoted pet parents! When asked about the pandemic “baby boom” in 2020, the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> American Idol</a> alum responded sweetly. “I love being Aunt Kellie and that is perfect for me,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> in Aug. 2020. Kellie also laughed that she needed “another drink” after thinking about having kid and asked if the coronavirus spike in babies was “really a thing.” At the time, Kellie said they were proudly parenting “two little small puppies”.</p><h2>Kyle Wrote For Some Of Country Music’s Biggest Stars</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Kyle was a star in his own right! He’s a co-writer on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Garth Brooks</strong></a> hit “More Than a Memory.” The behind-the-scenes powerhouse also shared rights on <strong>Kimberley Locke</strong>‘s “8th World Wonder” and written songs for country icons including<strong> Kelly Clarkson, Craig Morgan, Jo Dee Messina, Trace Adkins, Tim McGraw, Scotty McCreery, Clay Walker</strong>, and of course, Kellie. He also collaborated with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Wynonna Judd</strong></a>, as well as <strong>Darius Rucker</strong> and <strong>Rachel Thibodeau</strong>.</p><h2>Kyle & Kellie Starred In A CMT Reality Series</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kellie-Pickler-Husband-5-Things-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>From 2015 to 2017, the couple starred together on the CMT reality series <i>I Love Kellie Pickler!</i> It spanned 13 episodes and premiered on Nov. 15, 2015. It showcased the positive aspects of their lives, and the couple reportedly went out of their way to keep it drama-free.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>“We want to keep it light and positive,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Associated Press </a>while shooting the series in 2015. “There’s enough darkness out in the world. And there’s enough negativity on television.” Kyle added that “there’s no crazy drama.” Further supporting their stance, the “Red High Heels” singer said, “There are no cat fights. We don’t have cats. … He’s allergic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qeo6WhlWK9qq%2FKpZyrZZiqwKOtzZ1kbW9nbYB0gI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html&text=Learn%20About%20The%20Late%20Musician%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html&title=Learn%20About%20The%20Late%20Musician%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html&title=Learn%20About%20The%20Late%20Musician%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html&title=Learn%20About%20The%20Late%20Musician%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkellie-pickler-husband-4778334.html&description=Learn%20About%20The%20Late%20Musician%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./coronavirus-sports-cancellations-live-updates-3964911.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Live Updates On Events, &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ikea-kids-product-transform-corsa-campervan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="It only took a 49 Ikea kids' product to transform my Vauxhall Corsa into a campervan">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
