I always kind of thought it was her, but part of you really hopes that someone that is supposed to love you or your family couldn't do that."</p><p>She continued: "It's like I'm living in a true-crime podcast or something you'd see on Dateline. That is what this feels like. It's unreal."</p><p>Katy said: "I can't even fathom why you think that you could shoot someone in the stomach and then make up a story and get away with it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Amber Rosales">Read More on Amber Rosales</h2><p>Jeffrey's sister said she had thought: "Wow, [Amber's] really that cold-hearted?"</p><h2>15 MINUTES OF FAME</h2><p>Amber had her short-lived reality stardom on MTV's Big Tips Texas in 2013 as she starred as a Redneck Haven waitress and bartender.</p><p>Her catchphrase on the show was: "Butta my a** and call me a biscuit."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The show ran for only fourteen episodes before being canceled.</p><p>Katy told The Sun: "I don't want to get her 15 minutes of fame back. She had her 15 minutes."</p><p>Katy expressed she was "angry at MTV" and felt as if they had to share a part of the blame in her brother’s death.</p><p>She said: “MTV has been exploiting people who are obviously in need of some type of help for ratings and paying them gives them monetary incentive to make bad decisions.”</p><h2>THE FAMILY'S STRUGGLES</h2><p>Katy also told The Sun it was difficult for Jeffrey's family to obtain the rights to his body from Amber.</p><p>Since Amber is the next of kin, Katy said she initially got full rights to Jeffrey's body and “wanted to have an open-casket funeral."</p><p>Katy shared that Amber didn’t sign the rights to the body in time and the funeral arrangement responsibilities fell to Jeffrey's parents.</p><p>Jeffrey's memorial service was held on May 7th in Texas.</p><p>Katy shared she has also struggled to have Jeff's clothing and belongings returned to the family from Amber's home, even after her arrest on Wednesday.</p><p>Amber is still in the custody of Jeffrey's belongings, despite being in jail on a $500,000 bond.</p><p>Katy explained: "It's really gross to think about someone who murdered someone else having that much control. She wanted that control."</p><p>She continued: "Insane, that she wanted to keep my dead brother's clothing.</p><p>"Talk about the level of control and just one more punch in the gut to me."</p><p>Katy concluded: "The whole thing is bizarre to me. My goal is to keep her off the streets and keep my community safe."</p><h2>EERIE PICS</h2><p>Katy told The Sun that victim Jeffrey and Amber had met in a grocery store in February of this year.</p><p>Between then and April, Katy said she noticed many "red flags" and strange behavior from Jeffrey.</p><p>She told The Sun that Jeffrey was extremely close and "tight-knit" with his family, including her 16-year-old daughter, and would "call every day."</p><p>Katy noticed after Jeffrey started dating Amber, that the daily communication dwindled down to a five-minute phone call "about every other week."</p><p>She said Jeffrey "wasn't very active on social media," but he would call her on Facebook messenger to get in touch and made comments about his phone "not working."</p><p>Although Katy said she didn't approve of Amber dating her younger brother because of the star's past, she still "tried to support Jeff" as he defended Amber.</p><p>Jeffrey told Katy he wanted to help her "get her life together."</p><p>Amid the "whirlwind romance," the couple rushed down to the courthouse in Denton County,&nbsp;<a href=#>Texas</a>, to get hitched on April 21, only four days before Jeffrey was murdered.</p><p>Katy shared the Justice of the Peace <a href=#>wedding photos exclusively</a> with The Sun.</p><p>Jeffrey and Amber stood side by side beside the American flag and the Texas state flag.</p><p>Amber wore tall stiletto heels and a black cocktail dress as Jeffrey wore a light chambray button-up with his arm around Amber's shoulder.</p><p>They both smiled at the camera and appeared happy.</p><p>In a second photo, the pair leaned in for a kiss, their arms wrapped around each other's waists.</p><p>Katy claimed none of Jeffrey's family knew about his plans to marry Amber.</p><p>Amber's case is still pending with the DA's office and she has not yet been assigned an attorney or a court.</p><h2><strong>AMBER'S ARREST</strong></h2><p>Amber was arrested on the morning of May 25 as she is suspected for murdering Jeffrey on April 25.</p><p>The Sun previously reported that Denton County police records said Amber fatally shot Jeffrey inside of a pickup truck as they drove down a road.</p><p>Officers responded to two 911 calls: the initial call was made by Amber herself as she told dispatchers her husband had "just been shot."</p><p>The second was made by a witness who reported a pickup truck had "just crashed in the yard of a residence."</p><p>When police arrived on site, Jeffrey was unconscious and occupying the driver's seat.</p><p>According to the local news outlet&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Denton Record-Chronicle</a>, the arrest affidavit said Amber was beside him in the passenger seat "crying and touching McBride."</p><p>Amber told police on the scene that Jeffrey intended on "doing a drug deal" and that "it went badly."</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Starcasm</a>, who initially reported on Amber's arrest, said she told officers her husband stopped the truck to talk to a man.</p><p>The report stated Amber told officers the third-party male "shot at the victim [Jeffrey] from the passenger side door, wiped the gun, tossed it into the vehicle where it landed on the floor and then fled on foot."</p><p>The reality star also told police the man had stolen the weapon from Jeffrey's family home.</p><p>Amber then told police Jeffrey's foot hit the accelerator, causing the pickup truck to crash into the nearby yard.</p><h2><strong>DISTURBING DETAILS</strong></h2><p>However, an on-site officer noticed "scratches on her left and right arm" and that her "right pinkie finger was swollen."</p><p>Amber could allegedly not explain the scratches and claimed her finger was broken from "struggling for the revolver."</p><p>The affidavit also noticed differences in Amber's story from when she was interviewed on-site to what she told more officers down at the station.</p><p>At first, she claimed the weapon was a pistol, then later said it was a revolver.</p><p>Police found the revolver in the front passenger side floorboard where Amber had been sitting.</p><p>Additionally, no surveillance footage in the area showed the truck stopping at any point nor a sign of a male fleeing on foot.</p><p>The Denton Record-Chronicle shared the affidavit that stated Jeffrey "sustained a single gunshot wound to his right side and the only person in the vehicle that could have fired the weapon was [Amber] and not an unknown male."</p><p>Amber was arrested from her home on Wednesday morning under the charge of suspected murder.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>This afternoon, Amber was given a second charge of "false accusation on Leo for sexual battery."</p><p>Amber was still on probation from an open case in Florida, and the judge ruled Amber's arrest Wednesday morning as a violation.</p><img
