I wouldn't have minded him dethroning Stephen. He had so much gusto," a fourth even sided with the rival and wrote.</p><p>"I respected Long for his risk," wrote a fifth as others congratulated the ongoing winner for living to fight another day.</p><p>"Few would have the sheer gumption to go all in like that. Nothing but respect," tweeted a sixth viewer.</p><h2>STEPHEN SEASON</h2><p>Stephen, 38, has already qualified for the <a href=#>2023 Tournament of Champions (which right now only has male contestants)</a>.</p><p>He's the second contestant to do so in a week along with <a href=#>High School Reunion Tournament winner Justin Bolsen, 18.</a></p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Longmont Leader</a>, Stephen has been a Jeopardy! fan for 25 years “but he never imagined that he would be on the other side of the television.”</p><p>Stephen took an <a href=#>Anytime Test</a> – the official&nbsp;qualifier exam – in 2020 because his wife: "kind of noticed that I knew all the answers."</p><p>Stephen’s win on February 17 saw him miss what many viewers thought was an <a href=#>easy Final Jeopardy.</a></p><p>The selected category was “National Parks” and the clue was: “It’s named for a river indigenous people call MI TSE A-DA-ZI, translated by French-speaking trappers as ‘Pierre Jaune.'”</p><p>Stephen failed to guess “Yellowstone,” leaving Ken to knock, “That’s literally what ‘Pierre Jaune’ means in French.”</p><p>That said, the champ, who has a PhD in physics and works for a fin-tech company called Emburse, per Longmont Leader, redeemed himself final-wise on March 13th's episode.</p><p>He doubled up on the final clue and that's how he clinched his fifth win against Roy Camara which was an impressive coffin nail of a moment.</p><p>Stephen dished on Reddit: "After this game, I had to sit down in the restroom in the contestant changing area for a few minutes until I stopped shaking."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Stephen was also clocked by fans watching yesterday's episode for responding to a clue with <a href=#>"is that" instead of the classic "What is".</a></p><p>He posted to Reddit: "It's phrased in the form of a question, they accept it. You'll probably bring down the full wrath of the internet if that's your normal mode of response-giving, but I'm not willing to test that hypothesis."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/newcomer-long-nguyen-makes-heartbreaking-803079552.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/newcomer-long-nguyen-makes-heartbreaking-803079554.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/newcomer-long-nguyen-makes-heartbreaking-803079560.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZmh%2FcYSPaKGep6CWv6XFjKWmp59dma6quNhmm6itkqGybr%2FTnqehnZ5ixKauwWauoqaemr9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html&text=Jeopardy%21%20newcomer%20Long%20Nguyen%20makes%20%27heartbreaking%27%20blunder%20that%20cost%20him%20the%20chance%20of%20dethroning%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20newcomer%20Long%20Nguyen%20makes%20%27heartbreaking%27%20blunder%20that%20cost%20him%20the%20chance%20of%20dethroning%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20newcomer%20Long%20Nguyen%20makes%20%27heartbreaking%27%20blunder%20that%20cost%20him%20the%20chance%20of%20dethroning%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20newcomer%20Long%20Nguyen%20makes%20%27heartbreaking%27%20blunder%20that%20cost%20him%20the%20chance%20of%20dethroning%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-long-daily-double-stephen-webb-winner.html&description=Jeopardy%21%20newcomer%20Long%20Nguyen%20makes%20%27heartbreaking%27%20blunder%20that%20cost%20him%20the%20chance%20of%20dethroning%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joshua-david-evanss-wife-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joshua David Evanss Wife: Who is Joshua David Evans Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./monique-family-life-after-lockup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Derek Once Again Keeping Secrets From Monique in 'Life After Lockup'?
