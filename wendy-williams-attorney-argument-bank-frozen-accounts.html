We went into the Wells Fargo branch and we spoke to the branch manager. We told him what was going on."</p><p>The attorney said that the 58-year-old host's son Kevin Jr., 22, was also present during the bank visit.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Wendy Williams">Read More Wendy Williams</h2><p>LaShawn said they had as of yet been unable to get a hold of Wendy's bank statements, which were being mailed directly to her New York residence.</p><p>Her son also wanted to set up online banking for his mother while she was staying in Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>"Wendy said she wanted to get access to the accounts," LaShawn continued, and said the bank manager had told her: "'Well, we don't do that in the retail branch. That's the Wells Fargo advisors, let me see if I can get somebody on the line.'"</p><p>LaShawn continued to claim: "He called Lori (Lori Schiller, Wendy's longtime financial adviser). He went into another room and had a conversation with Lori and&nbsp;came out.</p><p>"He said Lori was willing to talk to Wendy, but that&nbsp;she doesn't want anybody else in the room when she talks to Wendy.</p><p>"So Wendy said, 'No, why can't she talk to me with my attorney, I can understand if my son has to leave out of the room, but I want to keep my attorney here.'"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>LaShawn added: "And Lori said 'No, I want to talk to Wendy alone,' and if Wendy doesn't want to talk to her alone, Lori&nbsp;wouldn't talk to Wendy."&nbsp;</p><p>The trio then left the bank empty-handed. &nbsp;</p><p>A source confirmed the interaction and said that&nbsp;it had caused concern, as it was unusual for Wendy to come into a brokerage office, with people in tow and ask for access to her accounts.</p><p>The branch was also not where Wendy would typically have conducted business- which is back in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>In a lengthy statement, which LaShawn posted to Instagram on Thursday, she alleged that she is being barred from being in contact with Wendy, and blew off any allegations that there was a conflict of interest in her remaining on the case involving Wells Fargo.&nbsp;</p><p>The statement began: "To be clear, there was never a conflict of interest, the judge and Wells Fargo did not want me on the case because I couldn't be bought. &nbsp;</p><p>"I would never stand by and watch my <a href=#>client be taken advantage of</a> so they did everything to get me out of the picture including threatening to report me to the Florida bar if I communicate with my client.</p><p>"Their goal was to get Wendy back to New York to control her when Wendy was doing well in Florida with her son. She was on the mend, seeing her doctors every day, exercising and having coherent conversations. The person you see today is vastly different from the person you saw in videos in Florida.</p><p>"She has been isolated and I've done everything in my power to assist her. I have been impeded in my attempts to communicate with Wendy&nbsp;by the court.</p><p>"They don't want us to see a healthy Wendy hence the court's threats to sanction me if I spoke to the media or Wendy."</p><p>LaShawn then praised the TV host's ex-husband Kevin and his successes at Wendy's daytime talk show.</p><p>When asked for comment about the attorney's allegations, a Wells Fargo rep directed The U.S. Sun to their previous statements: "We deny any allegations of improper actions with respect to Ms. Williams’ accounts... The financial well-being of our clients is at the heart of everything we do."&nbsp;</p><p>Another statement issued at the time by the bank added: "Wells Fargo’s priority is the financial well-being of Ms. Williams and the preservation of her privacy."&nbsp;</p><p>Wendy's manager, Will Selby told The U.S. Sun "I don't know LaShawn&nbsp;personally, I've never met with LaShawn and I've only been dealing with certain individuals pertaining to&nbsp;the court and Wendy's&nbsp;Wells Fargo account."&nbsp;</p><h2>WENDY'S MONEY &nbsp;</h2><p>The 58-year-old former host's accounts went under the control of a financial guardian after her bank alleged that she was the victim of&nbsp;financial <a href=#>exploitation, dementia, or undue influence in explosive court filings</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-TV&nbsp;star, who was&nbsp;<a href=#>expected to regain access to her accounts in July</a>, still does not have access to them&nbsp;or her American Express card, which&nbsp;also seems to have gotten tied up in the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Will previously told The U.S. Sun that he has been trying to help Wendy work through the Wells Fargo situation.</p><p>He said he was trying to get the people involved in her accounts to understand "that what took place before, is not the case now, and that people that were working with Wendy before are no longer working with her."&nbsp;</p><h2>WENDY'S FINANCIAL GUARDIANSHIP</h2><p>As The U.S. Sun previously exclusively reported, Wendy's contentious battle with Wells Fargo&nbsp;to unfreeze her bank accounts ended after a&nbsp;<a href=#>New York</a>&nbsp;judge <a href=#>appointed a financial guardian to oversee her finances</a> in May.</p><p>As a source explained: "The guardianship process is complete,&nbsp;<a href=#>which means the court-appointed a financial guardian</a>. Now it's up to the guardian, Wendy, and the court as to how she will be accessing her money."&nbsp;</p><p>The bank now acts at the direction of Wendy and her guardian, one insider&nbsp;claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Several sources have also revealed&nbsp;that there was a temporary guardian in place since at least March,&nbsp;though it is unclear if the official court-appointed financial guardian, is the same person. &nbsp;</p><p>As one insider revealed: "The court can eventually decide to give&nbsp;<a href=#>Wendy back full control over her accounts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;end the guardianship- but that is up to the court."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In the meantime, Wendy is said to "still have a voice and she still has a say" when it comes to her finances, and while "she doesn't have 100% control right now, that could all change soon depending on what the court decides."</p><p>It is unclear who was named as Wendy's financial guardian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/scontent-ort2-1-cdninstagram-com-v-t51-2885-15-e35.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/splashnews-com-splash-news-pictures-usa-1-310-525-5808-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/wendy-williams-seen-arriving-back-sober-house-holding.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYGiDdX%2BWaK6eppSueri1y6WgmqWjYq61wM6rpZ6xXZa%2FqMHMnqWtZZKWu6x5xaums52eYq6kr86upa2rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html&text=Wendy%20Williams%20%26amp%3b%20her%20ex-%20attorney%20shared%20heated%20argument%20inside%20a%20Florida%20bank%20days%20before%20her%20accou&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html&title=Wendy%20Williams%20%26amp%3b%20her%20ex-%20attorney%20shared%20heated%20argument%20inside%20a%20Florida%20bank%20days%20before%20her%20accou" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html&title=Wendy%20Williams%20%26amp%3b%20her%20ex-%20attorney%20shared%20heated%20argument%20inside%20a%20Florida%20bank%20days%20before%20her%20accou" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html&title=Wendy%20Williams%20%26amp%3b%20her%20ex-%20attorney%20shared%20heated%20argument%20inside%20a%20Florida%20bank%20days%20before%20her%20accou" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwendy-williams-attorney-argument-bank-frozen-accounts.html&description=Wendy%20Williams%20%26amp%3b%20her%20ex-%20attorney%20shared%20heated%20argument%20inside%20a%20Florida%20bank%20days%20before%20her%20accou" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stranger-things-couple-charlie-heaton-natalia-dyer-hail-cab-nyc-8418860.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Stranger Things' Couple Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer Hail Cab in NYC">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./morgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikToker Morgan Bailey's Baby Daddy Reveals Himself">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
