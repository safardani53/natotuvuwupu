Spielbauer was convicted of killing his ex-wife, Robin. She was found dead in a ditch at the side of a road in Texas in 2014. He was sentenced to life in prison with a $10,000 fine, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KFDA News Channel 10</a>. But it wasn't an open and shut case. In fact, it was the subject of the <a href=#>Dateline</a> special The Pink Gun Mystery.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jeremy's wife at the time, Katie Phipps, was originally charged with Robin's murder. She served a year in prison before the law caught up with Jeremy, and Katie was exonerated. Only a few years have passed since this all happened, but where are Jeremy and Katie now? There have been ongoing legal issues surrounding this case that brought those involved in and out of court.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where Is Jeremy Spielbauer Now?</h2><p>In January 2020, the seventh court of appeals reversed his conviction. "The court ruled the trial judge abused their discretion by not allowing his defense attorney to challenge some members of the jury pool," states <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another article by KFDA News Channel 10</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>But KFDA News Channel 10 recently reported that the state won the appeal. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals sided with the prosecution and said that there were no errors when picking people for the jury. But now the case has to go back to appeals again to determine Jeremy's claims that his lawyer gave him bad advice when he was being questioned by the cops. For now, Jeremy is still behind bars.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where Is Katie Phipps now?</h2><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC 7 News</a> reported that Katie was a paralegal and in law school.

She had reportedly been arrested three days after Robin's body was discovered.</p><p>"Luckily it was in this district attorney’s office where their investigators were committed to their job to find the truth," she continued.</p><p>In January 2020, the host of the Dateline special The Pink Gun Mystery, Josh Mankiewicz, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted to congratulate Katie</a> on graduating from college. "#Dateline viewers will remember Katie Phipps from 2018’s The Pink Gun Mystery in which she was locked up on murder charges ... until the real killer was unmasked," he said.
